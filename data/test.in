You have my word.  As a gentleman
Sure have.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
You know Chastity?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
What good stuff?
Wow
She okay?
Who?
Neat...
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
What's normal?
Like you care.
You set me up.
What if she never starts dating?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
So they tell me...
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
How many people go here?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
It's a lung cancer issue
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
What've you got for me?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What 're you talking about?
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Where ya goin?
You just said
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I'm on it
What?
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Does this conversation have a purpose?
You and Verona?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
What's this?
William didn't even go to high school
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
I didn't have a choice.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Who?
Are you following me?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Why'd you let him get to you?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
BIANCA
So what did I have an effect on ?
Good call.
A soft side? Who knew?
How?
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Because you're making decisions for me.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Hi.
Macbeth, right?
So Dorsey can get the girl?
What?!
Ever been to Club Skunk?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
In the microwave.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
Are we going to argue?
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.
I don't want you to wait for me.
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Appointment to what?
No...
But we do have a lack of notaries. You should contact my administration.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
He understands.
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
All of them!  Just lies!
I am listening, my son.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
What did they say about Granada before today?
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
... Into a monk...
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What about Oleg?
But it's...
What else do you need?
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I can't take you to my place.
So...the station is empty?
Did you ever turn tricks before?
They're not gonna send you right back.
Is he your boyfriend?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
A cop?
It was my decision, not his.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
But Chief?  Over this??
What was that, Korfin?
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Any I.D.?
Only one guys checked in?
Are you hit?
What's wrong?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Pretty.
This isn't homicide school.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
You're Polish?
You got any better ideas?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
You wanna talk to her alone?
I don't have a girlfriend.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
So...who's Nicky?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Is it drug related?
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Well, that's great.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
See you later.  Good luck.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
How old are your kids?
And what do you do with the bones?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Yes.
How long are you planning to stay?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Who is he?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Turn that fucking thing off!
You said speak Czech!
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
I did.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
What is that?
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
Traitor!!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
It's easy to learn.
We started over, you can too.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
I know.
Alright.  Go ahead.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Yes...he's my friend.
I'll take him.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
You okay?
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Oh yeah, why?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
Mouth's clean, too.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
What are you gonna do?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
How?
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Are you reasonably awake?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
It's the last one.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
The antenna has to be replaced.
If you're determined to revive the crew now, I can handle the whole thing myself. There's no need for you to trouble.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
How many days until you come home?
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you mean.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Five by five, Frank.
Do you have any idea of what is causing this fault?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Pay money?
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Here you go, baby.
Where's ganz?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Yeah.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Hey, this works pretty good.
We eat when I say we eat.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you?
Last night.
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
What are you talkin' about?
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Let's go.
They saved your ass, convict.
Where's the money?
Musta got some primo bondsman.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
Thanks.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah...
Jack?
How did they get away?
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
He ... he wants me to help him skip town.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
What'd you do?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
Thanks for the coffee.
Great place for lunch.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
You real down?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Whaddya think?
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Where is he?
Tell me.
How would you know?
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
How hot are they?
Rosalie, you okay?
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
She's an exception..
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
What kind of mission?
Good luck..
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
And then?
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
Where's Leeloo?
Leeloo... is... she's...
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Do you love her?
I don't have time... I need to know.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
At least, the cat comes back.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
How do I look?
I don't need one.
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
...Priest...
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
Eto Akta Gamat!
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
...Ma???
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
I don't think this is a good time...
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
To save the world.
I'm not going.
It's my wife.
I thought you were divorced.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Learning language.
Where you going?
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
I want to sleep... forever...
Been here long?
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
It's not?
This is all that survived?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Talk English Doc.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
This thing solid?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Options.
Recommendations.
Yes, Sir!
How's our deal coming along?
I'm not accusing you...
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I know.
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You're killing me...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Who are you calling?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What are you talking about?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
That's five thousand dollars.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
We can do that.
I'd rather you didn't.
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Machine's in?
What are these for?
What are you... ?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Call me Tom.
Alright, Tom.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Celebrity Films.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Don't ask questions.
I don't know...
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Keep moving.
Easy enough for you.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
That's right.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You almost went over your limit.
He's lying.
Truman Capote.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Specialty product.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
I'm a working stiff, pops.
Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag?
Uh huh, pleasure.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
Nothing remotely like this.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm not positive this means anything.
I'm here.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
Yes... ?
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Yes, but...
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
She just seemed... depressed... ?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
I didn't mean to...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I remember.  You just left...
Who are you?
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
No, sir, he is not.
Okay, I'll take it all.
No, you may not.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
You alright?
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
I can't go back to sleep again.
We'll figure it out.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
You in a hurry?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Rick stayed later after school with Kristen.  She wasn't feeling very well.
Is there something we can do?
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
You look great!
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Avoid-all-contact-day.
It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no.  He is my responsibility.
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Is that who you're waiting for?
She doesn't want me around
Who says I don't like you?
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
You're right.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
But Dad --
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
Who's Jacob?
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
But I've seen her grave.
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
He's right.  Sometimes I feel like I'm living with Melicertes.
Look.  Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard.  He was bitching about it at the party last night.  He was under pressure.  We all are.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
You, too?
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
So they caught up with you, too?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
Well?
Seems to be all around...
What course, Skipper?
Now they feel it...down below.
Anything ---
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
All ready?
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
Swell!
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
To navigate, won't you have to... see your way?
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
Twombley involved?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Chub says you're fired.
I plan to. Soon.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
You heard the news.
We bought you.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Yeah.
You might not kill it.
You think so.
Mmm.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Hmm.
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
No brag. Just fact.
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
In the chest.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
You stayed away?
Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What?
Open the door. We're late.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Yeah.
You know.
I guess they're stupid.
I don't want to.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
She won't be here for a half hour. Think you can stand it that long?
Sit right there by yourself if you want. Wait for her by yourself. That's fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going downstairs.
Dad.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
How about a Big Mac?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
I want to go home.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
What do I have to do for it?
Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
I know who it is.
Good. Who?
See you tomorrow, maybe.
I'm sorry about what I said.
Call me.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
I know your parents.
This is nuts.
What happened?
You're not using it today?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Who are you?
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
Something about my father?
It don't look right.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
His office. You mean my old office.
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!
Nothing.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
Where's Ma?
In the living room.
Everything you know is from me.
Crawl!
Rolfe.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
No thanks. I don't drink.
What about Margie?
I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Alice...
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
When I write my memoirs I think I'll devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard Air Force One.
Your father never means to be so...
Mom?
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
So, you study world events, little one. That's good for a girl your age.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
He didn't leave us.
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
There they are!
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Uh, we got a problem here.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
We don't know that.
I prefered the terrorists.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming it's just an exercise.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
Who did this?
We're not going to make it.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
You're pointing a gun at me.
No.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Yes, I'll do it.  Just leave my family alone.
Twenty minutes?
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
May I speak to you for a moment?
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
What?
I miss you. And I miss her.
Excuse me?
Someone should give you a raise.
and if that means negotiating...
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
This is the President.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
IT'S OPEN!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
What's the story?
Did you feel that?
Felt like a large asteroid.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
Te...!
Ted, what's wrong?
Elaine.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
Ted, we're taking off!
What are you doing, Ted?
Ted.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Ted, the lever!
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Simon.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Simon, what's happening?!
Maybe.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Scraps.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
No.  I mean your relationship.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
No. I'm all alone.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
What did he have?
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Ted, what are you doing here?
What's the matter?
I love you, Elaine.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Yes?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
See them, Elaine?
We'd better get back now.
Yes, Captain?
How ya doing, honey?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
Roger.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
The cockpit? What is it?
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
William Harcourt?
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
Here?
... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
Terrific.  A real pillar of the community.  Was Hubley missing anything when they found him?  Was he ripped off?
What is wrong?
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
What's this?  What's going on?
Nothing.
Nothing?
How the hell do you know that?
I believe I should interview the widow alone.
Did you talk to him?
Rudyard Kipling?  No shit?  Listen, we just need a minute of your time...
But I-- .
Your mother mates out of season.
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Your home is quite disordered.  I thought perhaps you had been burglarized when I walked in.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
Where'd you get this?!!
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
We all did.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
Uh, George...
What is it?
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
One of the two men was Hubley, right?  What about the other one? Did you know him?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
What kind of test?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community...
Christ.  I never saw such a buncha old women.  You want me to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
Movement!
Can't lock up...
Talk to me, Hudson.
Okay, let's do it.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Uh,...Apone, I want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the APC, over.
You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
How long until it blows?
I'll go.
What?
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
Have they located my daughter yet?
Is she...?
Amy.
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
If I go.
Yes, and I've read it.  You wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
That the atmosphere processor?
No good.  How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry?  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
You son of a bitch.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
We're talking thermonuclear explosion.
I don't know.
Sir?
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
...We're coming in.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Looks like it stung him.
I don't care how!  Think of a way.  Think of something.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
They cut the power.
Nine meters.  Eight.
Casey.  She's my only friend.
I don't want you for a friend.
Why not?
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Where is she?
Newt.  Newt, wake up.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Follow me, please. The Archbishop would like a word.
Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you?
Indeed.
Good morning.
Yes.
No.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
And how will you make him keep it?
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
I've come to dinnnnnner!
I want to go back to Vienna.
Yes!
Where?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Yes.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving.
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
There's a young girl to see you.
Stanzi!
We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder?  This is! a very nice girl.
Wolfi.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I?
I can't write it!
Go back to bed.
He's terribly busy, sir.
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
Really?
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
Why you?
Where's our friend?
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
You do me too much honour, Sire.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
My pleasure.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well!
What do you mean, Sire?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
Is she not here?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
They say you're in debt.
Pupils?
How many?
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Where does he work?
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
Where?
Opera? Opera!
That's right.
Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them.
German!
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
No.
You won't be teaching this one either. She's my wife.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Mio caro Adone.
Ah!
Yes! yes! er, on  the whole, yes, Majesty.
Did you like it, then?
Herr Mozart, what brings you here?
Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't.
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come?
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Did my work please you?
How could it not, Excellency?
Yes?
You flatter me.
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
What happened? Is it over?
You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
The Fire.
Yes.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
That's wonderful!
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
What you think, Mozart, is scarcely the point. It is what His Majesty thinks that counts.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
What do you want?
About what?
What do you want?
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Are they?
I do not seek forgiveness.
How well are you trained in music?
And do they believe it?
Did you try?
You cannot say that!
No? Was Mozart a good man?
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
But not his body.
Where?
What anger?
About the ballet.
Bravo, Your Majesty!
I know we banned this play, but frankly I can't remember why. Can you refresh my memory, Herr Director?
Here I am, my angel.
What? Who the devil are you?
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
I can't wait.
Well, I don't know! I mean you're a delicious, delightful, delectable little bird, but don't you think you might be just a little tough?
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
That lady is back, sir.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Can we come in?
But he's all right?
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
The American? Yes, duck.
How did he look?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Yes, I should think so.
What?
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
You're a very beautiful girl.
I dream of death mostly.
I know.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
What? Oh, yes, please.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Will you think about it?
Now I'm embarrassed.
Alex?
Yes?
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
No.
Feeling better?
How are we feeling tonight?
No.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
There's no call for that kind of language.
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
There were witnesses?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Did you see Jack?
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Yes.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
I don't know.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Jack, we'd better go.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
There aren't any coyotes in England.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
See anything?
Jack?
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
I can't stand it.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Nurse!
Nurse!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
I wanted to see you.
Yes.
Hi, Jack.
You don't have to say anything.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
Thank you.
Dr. Hirsch?
What here?
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
Oh.
Hello, Tom.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Matt?
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
What about?
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Oh!
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Fifty thousand dollars!
Me?
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Doesn't that come next?
Well, what?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
What's this?
My apartment.
No. I know the answer to that one.  I think you'd better take me home.
Yes, sir.
I'm not interested in what you think.
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Shall we let the people come in?
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
The theatre?
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Longer.
Where is he now?
Yes?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
I want you both to take the day off. Go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
Helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the Berengaria sailing next week.
All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
The lobby's half filled now.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Yes, sir.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Why?
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Oh, Matt . . .
Yes, why?
It couldn't have been earlier?
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
wasn't anywhere near this place
Then who changed it?
Yes.
What time did you get in?
I guess so.
This is healing?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
I swear --
I'm sorry, Cole.
He's not bad at it.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
You have no shame.
You shut up now, boy.
I could use the walk.
Where you boys going?
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
What is wrong with you?
Thanks for the help.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
So what do we do, General Lee?
I got seven thousand.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
A bad idea.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Still smells fishy.
Fine. We hit this bank.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
They gonna rush us?
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
What the --
My little Web did that?
You know you're welcome any time!
He's going to be fine, right Daddy?
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Hell of a war.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
"Big and older"?
You are a charmer.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Bob's upset.
Jesse, we're outlaws.
You've killed your fair share of men.
If I could go back to farming --
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
We're doing this for Ma.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
We're drunk.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Yeah, Jimmy?
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
Can't argue that.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Jesse, are you awake?
Jesse, is that your hand?
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Where will you find such a girl?
Yep.
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Me neither.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Zee.
I don't understand.
"Hmm" what?
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Don't swear.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Mmm.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
Thanks.
You okay, Jesse?
Well, not exactly.
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
I swear.
Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
The final route for the railroad is complete.
Parker.
What is that?
That.
This is him.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
This is no game.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course,  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
What is that?
On a lot of lithium?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
Are we here?
Is it a what?
I'm ignoring you.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Why?
What are you doing tonight?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
Everybody's rich.
He has a great body
Are you using minoxidil?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
But what about the past? Our past?
I'm just leaving.
Good coloring.
Can I help you?
Doesn't he live here?
No, he doesn't.
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Lucky, I guess.
Uh huh.
That's Paul Owen.
Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
Like what?
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Don't, I'll drink it.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
After six.
Anywhere you want?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
Want a bite?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
No, not really.
Interesting.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Patrick Bateman's office.
Jean-I'm not-
Patrick? I can't hear you.
...to the office this afternoon.
So, what do you do?
No. Flattering, but no.
Welt...it depends, why?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Hubert's? Oh really? It moved uptown, right?
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Uh huh?
No.
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Coffee?
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
Well, what's the topic of discussion?
Would you rather I not smoke?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
How well did you know him?
Yeah. You know...hang out.
Actually, yes.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Had his apartment been burglarized?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
That's so typical, isn't it?
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
So...you hang out here a lot?
I mean they want to get caught.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
What?
Well, I could he wrong.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Marcus?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
Yes, Owen?
Is that a raincoat?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
What shit? Now where do we have reservations at? I mean I'm not really hungry, but I would like to have reservations somewhere.
Is it over?
I'm just screwed.
That took some fun out of --
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.
I know, I know.
Teddy was killed last night.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
...Whaddo I do?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
We tried!
Could work with a new switch. There may be a few more things hidden.
Milo. What's up?
You really wrote this just today?
Had you talked to him much lately?
Talk about work? Never!
Oh. Yeah.
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Gary?
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
I think you should go.
...You wanna work -- here?
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
Lisa.
You know my name.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Did I say something?
What've you got there?
Why would you do a thing like --
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
But why would they --?
He's out of prison?
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
What about "60 Minutes."
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
What?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
But they'd still get the idea, right?
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Why were you so careless?
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
Does he know you know?
...He knows.
She's a programmer?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Maybe he'll get back to work.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
You seem surprised to see me.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
May I wash you?
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Thank you.
Be careful.
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
When do I begin?
Thank you, Exposition.
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
There's one more thing, Austin.
What's the other?
Excuse me?
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
Yes Basil?
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
My meat and two veg.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Why?
A limousine has just pulled up.
Hello, hello. That's Dr. Evil's cat.
How do you know?
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
I haven't had fun like that since college.
I'm sorry.
I am not.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Of course, luv.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
Does that make you horny?
Not a good time to lose one's head.
Indeed.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Austin, what's your point?
Follow me! We're going to have to jump over the rail!
Lay it on me.
Danger's my middle name.
That's not mine.
I'm telling you, baby, that's not mine.
Noooooooooooooo!
Is it one of ours?
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Shut up.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
We've got a lot of work to do.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Ow! You shot me!
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
What did you say?
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
Great.
Why?
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Did you ever want to?
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
We don't judge here.
No, he's really evil.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
... bottle ...
... love ...
... love ...
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Then you can't come in.
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
This isn't a game.
How curious ...
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
Would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
The Institute ... the funding ...
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
Too many cooks --
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Doctor Peel, I presume?
I had a spot of bother at the door.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Rules are made to be broken.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
Do you?
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
Steed, we really must be --
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
I wasn't about to.
But if someone miniaturized the process...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
You followed me.
I thought you played by the rules.
No, after you.
I told Mother I took care of you.
You lied.
Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
What is it?
You first.
Trubshaw again? What now?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
I'll be back ...
Where are you going?
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
Mrs. Peel?
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
I was getting to it.
Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father.  Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...'
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Insane ... ?
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Where?
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Mrs. Peel -- ?
Aren't you forgetting about something?
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
You're kidding.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
Thank you, sir.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
But a fabulous cook.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
That feels so great.
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
I can't trust you!
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Your whores never showed up.
That's it, prick lips.
It's true.
What can I be doing for you?
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
I'm separated.
Where the hell is he?
What's the matter?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
Oooooo.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
Who was that?
He look familiar?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
You're late again, Rick.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
-- Knock it off!
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
I like what you've done with the place.
What, you've never seen one before?
In the Field Museum once.
Sheep don't count.
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
Ya love it, probie?
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Goddamn it Stephen!
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Ready?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
Look, you are sorta making yourself fair game.
Thanks for the insight.
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
Everybody did.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
-- What are you doing here?
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
Anything else?
What are we going to do about this?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Arson.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Homey.
Yeah? And just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
Leave Stephen out of this --
Hi.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
I'll see ya around, huh?
I'm close... but I can't get who it is...
What?
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
The outlets.
Oh Jesus Christ...
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
I need another one, sir.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Glass?
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
But the right guess on this is arson.
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
What?
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Are you going public with this?
Your brother was a good man.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
No need to be modest, Brian.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Aren't you even curious?
What?
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Fireman shit?
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
The great communicator.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Look, I'm sorry I --
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Nobody cares, Ronald.
And old ladies?
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
What do you listen to, Stephen?
It knows us. This one knows us.
We still haven't found a connection between the victims.
Yeah.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
You took the chalice.
Let me think about it.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
I got them all going for Oakland. With bullshit money. We'll cover the $800.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
What money?
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
You don't have the demographics.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative.  You got your ways to affect change, I have mine.  And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
No offense.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
What do I have to do?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
Why?
I'm not playin' myself no mo'.
How you sound?
Word!!!
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
Yep, you guessed it.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
Who are the other characters?
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
What do you want?
Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
That's what I'm askin'.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
Enough about me, what's happening with you?
Nuthin' I can't handle.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
Do you know how you will use him?
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Can't you just quit?  Walk away?
What is your problem?
Your life will never be the same.
Same here.
What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest.
I thought it was appropiate.
He's just playing big brother.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
Don't make me have to use this.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
You feel good, not nervous?
No joke.  Serious.
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
What you did is dead wrong.
It looks delicious.
How's the food?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
No.
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Let Myrna finish.
Yes you!
I never had a really real pair before.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem...
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
...yes she did.
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
How be dat?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
You don't read, do you?
You can go now.
Good day to you, young sir.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
O'Grady.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
What is the service, sir?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
Have you taken my message to him?
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
The coward!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
All Europe shall hear of this!
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
For whom else have you worked?
I believe they will deport you.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Then you yield to me.
That is a trifle strong.
Have you not a man whom you value?
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
All the same, you must name an amount.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Is he all right, papa?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Who?
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
I don't want to go --
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
We don't need the tapes --
Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Where's the cabin?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
How do you know that?
Sir, yes, sir!
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Jesus, what happened?
So you killed him?
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
If not you, then who?
You're lying --
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
His chest was hamburger --
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
What happened to "degrees"?
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was...  Enough to almost kill him.
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun --
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
Well?
Something funny, Levi?
Jail if he's lucky, the gas chamber if he's not --
Why?
Where are they!
This is Warrant Officer Julia Osborne, the closest thing we have to an in- house investigator.
A few years ago, the Army picked our good buddy as their go to non-com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. He even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming Basic cadets across the country.
Who killed Pike?
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
Tom, where are you going --
What the hell are you talking about --
You think you could explain all this to me?
You're a good soldier, Bill.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
Ah, Christ
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
He's in interrogation?
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
Good cop/bad cop?
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
Why do you care?
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Kendall maybe would have agreed, but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin --
That bugs you too?
Little bit.
That's a fantastic idea --
You wanted to get the truth.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Yeah.
Think it'll work?
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
What are you doing out here?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
Maybe we shouldn't go.
We should tell him we're not going.
He said what?
No one else heard it?
Because he'd shot Mueller.
Running out of time, are we? Tick- tock, tick-tock, how long till your witnesses fly the coop?
Dunbar's telling the truth.
What happened with Nunez?
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
So?
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
You want Kendall, don't you?
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
See! The big guy likes it.
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Who is she? Where does she live?
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's going to Auburn. The semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Now tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Lucky girl.
I was dreaming.
Because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
Stop.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
I never knew.
You were talking about your wedding.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
Okay.
You're not trying to run away?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Did you do any of that?
You think I'm up for it?
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
What did he say?
You know where the chemicals are?
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
What?
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
You think I'm fake.
The river.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
Oh.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I don't believe it!
This is it? The whole vault.
Oh. Oh.
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
You didn't become crazy.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You need to go.
They met at Auburn.
We rented a car.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
Did you and Dad have any other property?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
That's not a burn.
What?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Sorry. You've lost me...
What did he say?
And...
So?
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
No. It's not that.
Do you believe in love?
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Yes.
Yes.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Syevodnya?
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
No I don't.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
So uh...
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
You...
Excuse me?
Thank Christ for that.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I'm trying to quit.
I don't know.
Why?
Yes?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
Hi.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Can I put it in your mouth?
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
Better?
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
Rose... please...
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
Where's Ronnie?
Well I don't...
Don't need none.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Uh-uh.
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
You take it straight?
Tell me what to do.
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
I know that.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
What I love.
Why you say that?
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
What'chu sayin'?
He tapped that.
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
Y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
Gotta get that chain off her, Laz. Somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
The hell is this shit?
Heard about this morning.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
I skipped lunch.
That's right.
You could put it that way.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
What's on your mind?
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
I'm a what?
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Ronnie. Please, baby...
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Get rid of it.
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
-- I should tear your head off.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
Who do you think the Jap is?
Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
Not a prayer.
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Let's grab some food.
Cool?
What does Charlie mean?
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Nick!
Give us a break...
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Yeah...
I've continued working on the case!
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Nick!
A resort city, Beppu.
For Sugai.  Caviar, French cheese, ham... If you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, Sugai may feel obligated to see you.
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
I'm sorry.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.
Ich said you left.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
I need your help, Joyce.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.'  You think it's dumb of course.
I don't remember saying yes.
Who am I supposed to be?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
You'll get Ich killed.
Can't make you change your mind?
Guess I'm on a roll.
How big a package we talking about?
Dope?
Why?
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time.
It is not allowed.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
You had my help, detective.
The families who control the casinos?
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
With these?
If he won't cooperate?
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
One man.  He must be good.
I'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
I want more life, fucker.
The facts of life.  I'll be blunt. To make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  A coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
I've done some questionable things.
Also extraordinary things.
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
What generation are you?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Of course not.
His company made us.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
What's going on down there?
When?
I was just about to have my dinner.
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Well, when do you get paid?
When might that be?
Day after tomorrow.
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
What about a summary then.
And what in your estimation works?
Shot of vodka, please.
You want to see my friends?
Sorry, don't have the time.
How long you had these guys?
One more, eh?
How old am I?
Sorry.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Meaning?
But you haven't put in for emigration.
What if you change your mind?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
Yes?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
Why not?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I've already got more help than I need.
There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
You ever take a bath with a man before?
How are you doing?
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
I don't know... I think I missed something.
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
Hmmm?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
This feels stupid.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Bad?
Thanks.
Is this to be an empathy test?
Yes.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
No.
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
I'm tired of this.
Don't move.
You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
Of course.
Same thing.
But I understand what you mean.
What's your name?
You want to go home?
I don't have one.
What about friends?
Is that why you're still here?
Ah, you get hold of your friends?
As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
What makes you think so?
Hi!
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
You're lost?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
It was amazing.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
You don't?
Yes.
Heck, no!  What?!
It's Perry!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I haven't brushed yet.
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Why doesn't it never work out?
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
...Okay.
Two weeks.
What's the pay?
What's fair?
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Yes.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
One who's not a mutant.
Two weeks.
Never drive again!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
All right.
The guy with the underpants!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Adam?!
But, Eve, I would--
What?
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
A card?
Yes, sir.
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
No, son. A pitcher.
C'est bon, Monsieur.
I promise. Is that all?
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
I love Lucy!
That's right?
Who use to own it?
What's the capitol?
This must be very new.
No.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Bye, Adam!
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
I don't see anything!
Sure.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Sorry, Mom!
I'll be all right.
Yes?
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
What?
This is your bedroom?
No.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
How long will we have to stay down here?
Days??
Yes, dear!
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
To go up.
No.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
I've noticed.
Yes!
If I...you know...
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Watch this!
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Calvin!
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
Should we say a little prayer first?
Yes, yes it is!
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
We do?
I want him to at least see the sky!
He's smart.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
I thought ten years.
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
What are you bitching about now?
Stop it, you two!
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
What's it to you?!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Oh, no!
Gay.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
What do you want to do with it?
Give it back to him.
To get some frozen poultry.
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Buy it from me?
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
You did? A human ear?
Jeffrey?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Anything you can tell me?
Is that why you say it's horrible?
What is this? What color is it?
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
No, not at all.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
That oughta do it.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Nobody.
Shit. You better tell me something.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
Sure I'm alright. 
No.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
No. What is happening?
Hi, can I come in?
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Don? Are you in with them?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
Yes. Frank--
Whatiya mean?
What do you want?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Come on Dorothy.
I asked first.
I love you Don with all my heart.
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
You called me Jeffrey.
I did. Are you?
What?
It's okay. It's okay.
Hold me, Don.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
MOMMY!
Frank?
Look at these. What are these?
No thanks.
No thanks. What does that mean?
Heineken.
What?
Nothing.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
No, you're right.
Uh-uh.
Good to see you, son.
What else is new? Right?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Maybe so.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
What happened to him?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
Okay, thanks.
Who, me? Why should it?
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Goodnight.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yeah.
Everything okay?
You didn't tell him about me?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Okay.
What is it?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
You want to dance?
Let's wait for some slow one.
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Sandy? Could I talk to you a minute?
Come on out a minute, okay?
Up where?
Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I got a serious problem here. I'm not screwing around.
I need Il Duce.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Yes sir.
Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
Yeah, well...
What? What is it?
They got nothing.
We're here brother.
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Fuck!
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
For what?
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
Is that right, Rambo?
Oh, we're good man.
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by men.
Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck face?
She was in here when it went down.
What?
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
And the pennies?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
How many bodies, Greenly?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Who were the victims?
Oh my god!
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Promise me boys.
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man!
You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
Hello? You there?
But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct.
Yes.
Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
I believe these young men are right.
Forgive me father.
Don't do this my son.
Have you no fear of God?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
The... The funny man.
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
She's really kind of hot.
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
How was I ridiculing you?
It had an alarm.
Loop around real fast.
OK. Escape route. The most important thing you can have is an escape route. Just in case somebody's tailing us. Or even chasing us, as the case may be --
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
Where's the other stocker?
Holy shit.
What's wrong with him?
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
It's not a plan. It's just --
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
Obviously. That's a given.
This morning.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
Well, I didn't do it, did I?
I have an idea for that.
She doesn't need to know.
Shh.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
I think we better go home.
I'm not. But there's --
You can't just run home every time things get tough. First of all, we've got enough dough to --
Our money situation is not good.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
She needed it.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
You could give somebody a concussion.
Shit, Dignan.
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
OK. Man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. He is entering a white van. What time is it?
Eleven fifteen.
OK. Mark that down.
Yeah. It's pretty good.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Come on.
What?
Like amnesia.
How big is it?
So how is it in there? 
You're kidding.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
How does that feel?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
We're renegades from despair.
Why'd you want to help us?
Who?
Hector woudn't do anything.
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
See you.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.
Anthony, I --
What?
Were you adopted, Bob?
Was Future Man adopted?
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Yeah.
Are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
No.
Were you born in Mexico?
Yeah.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Where'd they come from?
That's your friend Anthony?
Yeah.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Well, what do you think?
I'm not allowed to drive those.
Not even for emergencies?
I thought your parents were in Italy.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
What are you talking about, Bob?
You stole a Trans-Am.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
Hang on. This is important, Bob. Anthony and I are responsible for the internal situation. The money and the people. You're responsible for the external situation. The streets and the getaway.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
I paid for it.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
He electrocuted someone?
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I told you they were there.
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
It's registered in my mother's name.
That could be anybody's.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
This could be a trap.
Come on, Dignan.
I'm going back.
Not in that car you're not.
Just get in the car, Bob.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Bullshit.
That's OK.
Scarecrow?
Do you have your own room?
Do you have your own cell?
Hold on --
I'm working on it.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Ground defense.
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Oh, yeah.
Why?
Can't get it. It won't... 
Well, I left some money in there.
No, my friend knows her.
You like Chicanos?
You a good pool player.
Guess I'll get another Tecate.
Come on in!
It's locked.
Treadstone.
I want to know what happened.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
And Bourne? Where's he now?
Excuse me.
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
Don't you want answers?
Don't know.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
Why not? It was just money.
No good options left?
In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
It was staged?
Jesus...
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
They loved you.  And I killed them.
You know I'm not.
I have to go now.
Felt a little light.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know who that is.
What's going on in Berlin?
You called it in?
-- my coat -- but we should --
But it ends up the same.
The Telegraph office.
So...
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
What if it's not who you think it is?
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
You hear me? I believed you.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
Abbott?
Your first assignment was Geneva.
What do you want?
Okay, how do you want to do it?
Okay, Jason, your move.
Looks like he's been detained.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Here?
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
It's a lot of money, Pam.
I want that area secured, I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Good luck.
Did you?
Some women like Dobermans --
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Do we know what this says?
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
Are we hacking or asking?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
But... what will you do?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We cannot defeat this --
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Does anyone know his politics?
Longshanks promised!
What news of the north?
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
So I did! And what was so important about it?
No, M'lord.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Wallace's followers.
When will his trial be?
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
I'll wait... back there.
Rest, William.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
How many?
Three, maybe more!
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
Good to see you again.
We must run in different directions!
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
I have faced him. Have you?
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
It matters not, he is thy king!
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Thank you for accepting.
Nor I!
You scare me.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
How do you know this?
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first.
What is it?
What?
And the bad news?
But you must have something to go on?
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
You know the answer to that.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
All the dads are gonna be there.
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
What does that mean for Evan?
How. Did you. Know that?
Just. Like. Jason.
Straight up.
Yes.
Are you hurting her?
Are you stupid or what?
Huh?
Oh God... what did we do?
I deserve a lot worse.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
So how's Tommy?
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
It was a long time ago.
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
So it didn't feel... weird?
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
Ha! Where's that?
What's happened to you?
Because you're... different.
I just thought you should know.
Which is?
Sure you don't want your wallet?
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Where are we going?
Is something the matter?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
I was?
Then you think it might have worked out?
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
What time is it?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
...yes.
We'll find out soon enough.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
So what's the point?
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Can... can... Can I have this?
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Listen to me good, Evan...
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Huh?
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Here you go, buddy.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Yes, I'll bet.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Oh, yes.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
And you want to know --
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Yes, Monsieur.
No thanks, Carl.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
It's not for sale.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose we do.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
Rick?
And Mademoiselle?
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
No.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
I will.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Yes, of course, we --
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
I didn't count the days.
I don't know the finish yet.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Please.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
Yes.
When will he be back?
Does he always leave so early?
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Goodnight.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
What happened with Rick?
-- Yes?
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Well then, perhaps you also ---
What for?
Thank you. I try.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
But we made a deal.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Yes.
I understand.
Yes. What is it you want?
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
What, again?
Victor Laszlo.
Okay.
He is traveling with a lady.
He'll take one.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Oh, how do you do?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Oh, no, Rick never --
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Huh?
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
I have. Sit down over there.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Uh huh.
Where were you last night?
Sacha, she's had enough.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
Put that phone down!
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Good. Then have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Then don't have a drink.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
Uh, my watch stopped.
No, I don't.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
It's bad.
No more water, you said.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
You're putting off the inevitable.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
What's so damn funny?
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
You can't make it.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
To tell you the truth -- you did.
What brings you out to the sticks?
Cold.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Merry Christmas eve.
Hey, look at you.
He is a cute thing.
This isn't working out.
Could you watch Jango?
No.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
Get back?  From where?
That about sums it up.
This is so unfair.
I love you, Chuck.
And how was your Christmas?
I most definitely say I am.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Don't you even think about it.
When'd you start working here?
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
What about the sender?
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
What's going on down there?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
You what?
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
We're warriors, not desk jockeys.  We've got to be bold.  You always want all your ducks lined up.  But nothing's 100 percent.  It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60.  Then roll the dice.
I beat the odds!
San Francisco.  And you?
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* him. What's his name again?
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
You cook very well!
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
What's she so emotional about?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
How many months are you?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
I know.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
A movie *outside*?
*What* will be okay?
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
Nothing.
I know, I'm sorry.
Please don't make me say it again.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
I can't go nowhere.
So many children. Are they all orphans?
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
There! You said it was boring.
I love you, Wally.
That's true.
You mean somebody asked?
That's a heavy sedation.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
*Liver* killed him?
I don't remember.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
Really! Is it serious?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Where are you going?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I'm stayin', Homer.
Where'd she get you?
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
I haven't read that.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
I thought it was my turn.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
I'm happy I amuse you.
Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! 
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
We heard that one already, Homer.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Rose Rose?
So what?
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Then it's malaria?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
When will he be home, Major?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
I told him that you all is sick.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
That Candy--she's the nicest girl I know!
She took off in the night!
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
So, what do you do?
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
Can --
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
We had to finalize the deal.
Everything looks in order.
This has to happen fast.
You're worried about recouping the loan. I already told you.
The standard ten.
Ten percent. Of how much?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Know who I am, Jake?
The Anti-Christ?
Your life flashing before your eyes?
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
I can see why you liked her.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Thanks. Did you know you shouldn't light three cigarettes with a match?
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
I was doing it for them.
We were back on.
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
So what? We hide, right?
Whoa. What?
This might just be me, but that is hands down, the dumbest fucking idea I've ever heard.
Well, this is just fucking great...
How's that? He works for Gillette.
She up for this?
I have a good crew.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
How much?
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
What -- What do we do?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
No.  What's my cut?
You get an equal cut.
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
You told me to change my hair!
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
How do you know I will?
How do you deal with --
He was looking out for you.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
What about what?
You got my cell. Leave a message.
Tick-tock...
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Yeah.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
What do we need another Shill for?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
Escorts!
I'm sorry. Nothing under Pearson.
King ain't gonna like this.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Stand up.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
It's not history.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
The King, huh? Nice going.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
Who?
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
Jack Manfred.
My car's in the garage.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.  No blow jobs. No screwing.
Why did you quit?
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Not like Matt, you mean.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
What kind of deal you looking to?
How about fifteen hundred?
What?!
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
Last hand.
I couldn't resist them.
You really are a beautiful woman.
I. sold the car.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
I had training. In the Republic.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
I loved it blond.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Are you drunk?
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
I'm on at nine.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Marion. It's a book.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
No.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
I've lived there.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
To coincidence.
There's a casino in this hotel.
The debts.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
He doesn't gamble.
Which side do you like?
They mean it.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
Let it go.
What for?
Hello...
Jani! Where are you?
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Who...
Of course I recognised him!
I'm Lucy.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where do you live, Jack?
What the fuck are you talking about?
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
You're talking about complicity.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
What happened to Bella?
What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Do you have a Salon Prive?
Why four? And not three or five?
Any exceptions?
You use two alternating, don't you?
Haven't you forgotten something?
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
That hair will have to go.
Thanks for the information.
I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
Where's the fail-safe key?
All right, then...
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
Huh?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Snap out of it, bomb.
Of course.
Well of course I exist.
It is intuitively obvious.
Right!
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
Of course not.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Mafhkin oble groop...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
What are you gonna name it?
Fred.
Veil nebula.
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
It is, Doolittle, it's the Phoenix! They glow with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.
Yeah?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up, disbanded over thirteen years ago.
Ah... pity, pity...
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What was that, Doolittle?
Sorry.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
We're running out of time, sir.
Talk to the bomb.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it Phenomenology, Doolittle.
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
No?
Okay, okay.  I can explain... You ever have to do something you really don't want to?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
Nothing happened between me and Tia.
Leave.  Now.
She was there...
I was crazy about you...am crazy about you.  But you keep everyone at arm's length like there's some great big dark something going on that-- I don't know... It's just that the more I tried to get close to you, the more you pulled away.
What is it?
Lemme put some clothes on.
No way.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Where'd you clip this?
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
Same old story.  Not interested.
A grand.
I don't get involved with guns.
I'll make it worth your while.
What else can we do?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
Hello...
Soon, baby.
Thank God.
You have good taste.  French, 1920's, attributed to Chitarus.
How'd you find me?
Too early to tell.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Lauren's not my wife.
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
So what are you gonna do about it?
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
Bent?
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
Gold leaf, art nouveau, French, early nineteen hundreds... I could probably fence this for three or four grand.
The other ones?
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
How much do you know?
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
You said you could help.
Your help.
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
You believe that?
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
You don't want to.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
Who is it?
A friend of your fiance's.
Who are you?
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
I think you should go now.
I understand.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
Then what?
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that?  Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
A long time.
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
A fog bank.
Only one I can think of.
Make the call.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
What if he's on the level?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
We gotta talk.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
But there's another side--
And you were a sympathetic ear.
A toy?
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
How'd you get her out of town?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
She was the one--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Huh?
Pick a song, Hawk.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Sorry.
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Right, slow...
So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?
Your man is the drummer, Peter Criss, right?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
You got in the car, didn't you?
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
What's in Sandusky?
...at twenty-thirty hours.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!
That's Sherry VanHafton.
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
Ok, dudes, follow my lead.
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Could be.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Go ahead, Jam.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
That's it?
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
What do you want?
Two hundred bucks?
Gimme your gun, boy!
Is that your final answer?
I did?
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
I feel bad for his family.
Yeah.
Donnie.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
How can you do that?
You'll know soon enough.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
We went to a hotel.
Wonder where we'll be then.
Why is that?
That was a compliment.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
With, like, images?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
And what?
That's alright... I understand.
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
We're moving through time.
Oh, yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
Will you please talk to me?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey. You OK?
Did you call the cops?
Come with me.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
Know what?
Where it came from?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
You're my only son...
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Who is Frank?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era.
Why should we care?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
Yes.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
Who is the boss?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Nothing.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Yes.
Yes. I went to jail.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
If God exists?
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
When will this happen?
What is going to happen?
Where is he, Donald?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
Whoa, Elizabeth. A little hostile, there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
Come again?
He was a year ahead of us?
How did you know --
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
What else?
How did this happen?
Rose.
Kitty...
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
There's no rule!
What is this shit?
No more fuckin' for her.
You're what?!
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Airport Ho-Jo!
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Yah?
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
I'm gonna need more caps.
Oh shit!
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Okay, okay!  Listen-up. Coupla notes from last night's dress rehearsal.  Number one, Gladys says a coupla yous are gettin' sexy with your hips durin' the "Physical Fitness" routine...
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Here, I didn't get any.
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
And the bite marks on my ears?
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Oh, naw. Hi.
This here's Loretta.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
Correction. This spunky monkey on my right is Terry Macey. And we are your Minnesota American Teen Princess State Board.
We're also the co-founders of the Minnesota Modeling Academy. Applications are at the tiki bar. We'll wave the fifty dollar application fee if you list a friend and put her address.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Hey, Ted, sorry. I didn't know your family was in the garage when I set it on fire!
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
Okay, everybody, listen up!
Enid ate a whole pan!
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
I will if you shut your piehole.
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
You get nothing, Hank, okay?
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
He should be king!
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
Take a letter.
Who to?
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
"My dear President"...
But you're my father -
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
Well - what is he now?
Half watch dog?
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
Oh no, I can't do it.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
She did.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
You're right about that guy -- I think we've got something.
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Well, we'll let that one go.  Now -- how many battalions you got?
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
Fine.  We gotta him. 
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Are you getting tired?
That's even a greater honor.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
That's what you think.
Give me that again!
Once more! 
You upstart!
Yes.
I don't remember.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
No... it was a seven letter word.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Oh, Rufus!
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
But -
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
Uncle, you can't do this!
I thought everything was working out fine.
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
You stay with me.
Oh... I've just been thinking about something that man Bytes said.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
He fell.  He falls.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
Now I think we really do understand one another.
You've acquired a taste for this?
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
It was a nice try, Treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
I don't understand.
I could easily arrange...
No, not that way. Broadneck and the others don't like to deal with patients directly. It makes them queasy... Do you have any photographs of Mr. Merrick?
Well, yes.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I am very pleased to meet you.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Mr. Treves says that you are in the theatre. Do you live there?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
You've never been?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Want to come out?
Of course! You want out?
Thank you very much.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
What's this?
Yes!
My name is...
I never thought to ask. How can you ever forgive me?
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
How long will I stay here?
Thank you very much.
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
How is your tea, John?
Not at all, John.
The children! May I see?
The cathedral is coming along nicely.
No, John, not one that I can see.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Won't come out, eh?
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Well...
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
And who might you be, sir?
Well... where is he?
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
Please! Please! What are those?
It was different...
But you LOVED her all the same...
We never went to bed together.
Five this week; how many the week before?
You're as bad as my father.
Who?
No!
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
The second note.
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
There is something I must ask the Gods...
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
But... How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
A lot of people like our singing.
I'm sure it's lovely.
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Your Majesty! We come from a world where there IS no music. Where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
Is there something the matter with it?
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Yes.
You don't love ME.
Oh, get it over with.
I don't suppose... no...
Oh! Stop talking as if we were married!
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
What a stupid idea.
FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
I met this girl...
I... I... KILLED her...
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
What are YOU doing here?
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
So?
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Row!
There is another way.
What's the matter with them?
What do you think?
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
You're wasting your time.
Your lord.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the sky...
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
You've lost your mind.
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
I know, Dad.
You went berserk...
So did your father...
I must only let the red rage...
Well, of course he is!
There is nothing we can do...
Dad!
Thorfinn! You can't die!
Yes, Mum.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
Okay, I guess.
Come over after I'm done here?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
Come up to Boston with me?
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Huckleberry Hound?
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Yes?
That's okay.
It's okay.
You know Wilmont?
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
I don't know.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
I don't know.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
Oh, yeah.
That's scary sounding.
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
Yo ho ho!
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
More?
Yeah, Tangerine?
No.
Oh?
Really? Is he cute?
Joel!
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I'm sure, I said.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Okay.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
What do we do?
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I love her.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Cool.
I knew.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
So go.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
What if you stay this time?
I think I should go back.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Well, you obviously don't know me.
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
It's true.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I just got in.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
It's them.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
Well... I did.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
How was it?
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
So you don't mind?
I miss you.
Yeah. Cool.
Definitely!
Stan... c'mon...
I know. Anyway --
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
We haven't checked.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
That's a good one.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
I don't know! I just said that!
How did I look?
What do you want, Stan?
I know what it is.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Howard, your one o'clock.
Order me a pastrami for after?
Okay, we're back in.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
Alexander Pope?
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
Well, where was Patrick?
He went home sick.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
I know who you are.
But I don't know how to polka.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
What is Debbie's position?
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it definitely was my fault.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
I have to go, Julian.
Why? Why do you have to go?
Thanks.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
A job for me?
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
Ballast.
Holy shit...
Justin?
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
Coffee.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
What's happening?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
What...?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
What happened?
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
...I don't want to die...!
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
We've got pressure.
Peters is right, no one's here.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
Captain Miller, I appreciate this opportunity...
Where has it been for the last seven years?
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
That is not acceptable --
Easy, Peters, we're okay, we're okay. Let's finish the sweep.
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
What about it?
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
I don't know...
We're leaving.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
I told you... She won't let you leave...
Your eyes...
What are you?
You can't have them. Go to hell.
Jesus...
Heading three-three-four...
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.
1500 meters. We're getting too close...
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
It is now.  We're locked in.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
Sir.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Smith, get out of there...
No, no, we just got her back together...
Maybe one of the original crew?
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
Weir can't be alive.
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
He's been past Mars?
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
Keep him talking.
You got any coffee?
Hey...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... 
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
Get them back --
A straight line.
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
Do they have pressure?
What is it?
What are you doing?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
Relax, it's casual.
He didn't.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
Where is Reed?
About me? How sweet.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
I can't take this.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Are you alright?
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
And they're changing into...
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
You're hot!
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
This is wrong in so many ways.
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
Apparently I can disappear.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Sweet.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
How's the IPO?
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Front page?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
What?
I mean, you broke up with me, right?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
What are you doing?
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours... Victor, that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
It's just business.
Victor, your scar --
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Please don't make this personal --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
This is how I dress all the time.
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
I take out the garbage.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
You are a virgin!
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Does Mom know you have company?
Jeff you have company!
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Do you want to take a quick swim?
Are you really a virgin?
I didn't see you this morning.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
It's definitely your mama.
She's in my biology class.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
I would. Yeah.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Yeah?
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Damone. It's Mark.
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Are you Linda Barrett?
Not if you're over sixteen.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Really?
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Does that ever happen?
No. But it's a nice idea.
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
What do you think it is?
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Yeah, like maybe never.
But what are you going to do?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
Yes.
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
You look like you could still be in high school.
What can I get for you tonight.
How about the point?
It's very warm out tonight.
Is this your first time?
Thanks for coming to get me.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Do you really have to go?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Are you ready to order here?
Two Cokes.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Naw!
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
Really?
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
Where ya comin' from, young man?
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
I have to go.
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on.
How about a check?
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
The cops?
There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
Lucy.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood!
Adrenochrome...
Right!
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician.
The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here?
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Stop!
We'll meet in three hours?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Who the hell would you call?
Oh!
You got something better?
What!? I'm not going down there again!
You seem mighty collected about this.
Fuck you too.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
We're better off.
Why do you take shit from him?
Yep.
We're going to get help.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
Will I go crazy or something?
Um-hmmm.
What? Really?
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
What's it for!?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Fully.
Open?
Covered.
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Oh? And what's that?
They were all over the place.
Clever fuckers.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Got 'cha!
NO, but I will lock you in.
What?
Hurry!
SHIT.
Well, maybe they migrate?
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Hold it!
I admire your strength.
We all have to be strong, right?
I'll do anything to help.
We should stick together out there.
What did we say about lying?
I'm not lying.
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
And on top of her political activities, now she's got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says she's through with motion pictures.
That's not the point. Frances Farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract, and she's going to honor it.
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
Thank you --
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
That's not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very concerned about your politics. He hears you've been donating money, speaking at rallies.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
What's up?
You don't think I'm good enough?
A rich actress.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Get your clothes on.
Get your clothes on, lady --
Without me.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Dick, we need some time apart --
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Dick...
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
What night?
...Don't you?
...I see.
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
But I'll never win that.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally ill, Frances?
Were you an alcoholic?
It's already started, Dad... with me.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
I know that, Dad, but --
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Bread?
Thank you.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
But, Kurt, I...
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Address?
Why?
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Just one minute...
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life.
What?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
Jesus.
I know what ability you're interested in.
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
Serious, huh?
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something... 
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
Don't start, Farmer.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
Oh my God, I look awful.
Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch.
I should've known...
Huh?
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Frances, You're crazy.
I love you, Harry. I love you.
I don't know.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
No.
And no people.
Where you goin'?
What'd you do?
Who's writing this guy's lines?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
I live here.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
'But how do I know you love me?'
You got it.
Then why did you bring them?
Well, who have we here...?
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Yes, Mama.
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
Don't I know you?
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
It ain't for lack of trying.
I see.
And what's that?
Normal. Average.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
Huh?
No! No!
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
And he drove me to mine.
What kindness?
Why?
You speak.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
I see it before me.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
Friend?
Like you? Oh, God, you don't know what you're asking.
Soon?
She's not for you.
So have I
I should go. I should leave today.
Have you seen Willie?
Don't cry, Elizabeth.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
And you?
Only you.
I give you my soul...
I thought I'd never see you again!
It is
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Now you've got him started.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
They'll hang him all the same.
That's blasphemy!
How much longer?
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
What happened up there?
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Professor Waldman.
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Why?
Melvin Belli.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Next Friday.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
How the... did he get in there?
Trouble?
It sounded like Brenda.
Marcie?
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
You said we were special.
Somebody'll see.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
You just had some lucky shots.
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
How about our last jay?
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Are you wet?
Mmmmmmmph?
Best over...
It's beautiful...
Cowboy.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
That's thirty percent.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Good luck.
Just my son and I.
You said it was just you and your son.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
Where are the keys to the motor home?
Not a chance.
Come again?
Sorry, I need everybody.
She's dead?
Yes.
No, I didn't.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
To your family.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Did he...?
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
What's this stuff?
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
I promise.
Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
No!
What's going on?
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What?
What you said to me in the room.
Yes.
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
Daddy's dead.
How many bullets left, kid?
-- see this, television!
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
I never said help us!
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Yeah?
What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy the road map and leave.
Do they have a waterbed?
All I'm saying --
Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig in and wait for things to cool down.
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
This ain't the time, Richard.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Where are you?
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
I've been accused of that wish.
Don't say my name.
Wow...
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
I'm fine, sir.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
Pardon?
No, sir, WHAT?
Straight up?
Across the board, sir.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'.
Ah, c'mon...
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
White House boys want a private meeting.
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Uh, ma'am.
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Miller.  Thought the guy was made of depleted uranium.  Really didn't expect to lose him.
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Thank you, sir.  But I like these just fine.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Unless you Whiskey Run.
You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil?
Just like you would be.
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits.  I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Jordan...
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
I saw an article...
So why are you telling me this?
No shortage of suspects.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
I don't know, I don't care.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
And how do you know that?
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
You got anybody, Wick?
Just askin'
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that?
32 feet, six inches!
"Dad."
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
I think you're the liar.
Do you?
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
I just wonder how that happened.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
You knew about us?
All right.  So who stands to gain if Jordan flames out in a big way?
Women.
I don't know.  Seems...
This ain't about some little soldier girl sloggin' her way through commando school.  The implications go way beyond.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
You okay?
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
I'll take them all.
You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
What are you doing here?
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
How do you know?
Who was that French guy, anyway.
What's it to you?
This is not the place...
I can't.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
We? I don't think so.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Well, I think you're cute.
And how should we do that, Sir?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
So you're in?
What's with the chewing gum?
How do I do that?
What'd they say?
Hello?
This is it?
Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
I won't and nothing you say-
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
At ease men.
We've got to stop!
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
What?  What?
... . Well  you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation?
What the hell is going on?!!?
What's happened?
You were holding it upside down weren't you?
And note the sucked in gut.
Alex you can't -just leave.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
A boy comes to the door.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
You said "the Commander.
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
He always has to make the big entrance.
Hi Brandon.
Brandon.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
It's okay. Listen-
Okay, we got it.
Okay...  Okay, now what.
Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know...
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
Okay, now. But-
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
U.... What do you think?
Never mind, Fred....
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
THAT'S why you built this ship?
Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it.
Oh, they're so cute.
I am SO SICK of being right.
How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram?
...Okay
Yeah, what is it?
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
We're doing episode 31?
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
Only answers to me.
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
JASON...
Maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
Are they behind us?
You're playing your good side.
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
You should have let me hit him.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Closer?  I can try.
You have ten seconds.
Yes.
Wait. What did you say?
Simpler.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Commander... Welcome to the Protector II.  Would you like to don your uniform?
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Theramin.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
To our brave guests.  Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  We are blessed to count ourselves among them.
Well... Sort of...
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
A model, only as big as this.
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Where?
All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me.  Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Hold course, Laredo!
Continue forward, sir?
enerao, I've host them. The maanetlsm o: the field Is disrupting our onstru- ~ait. There they are
Over three hundred miles.
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
The army needs you.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'.  The man's a budding Cromwell.  He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved.
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Me?  You apologizing to me?
Wil...
No.  I guess.
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Yessir.
Sir, I think no such thing.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
To hell with Arnold...
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
Lafayette is a child!
Gag on your own invention, then.
You think that?
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
General Lee is detained captain...
Detained by what?
A grand scheme?
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
They help me understand why we fight.
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
The man is a traitor!
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed.  And the revolution would be finished.  Tell King Louis, it's that bad.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
And, what 'prize' do you see?  What could we possible gain?
But, as usual, it will not go well for... them.  Martha, you must trust me.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
That's right...
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Martha!  For God's sake!
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
General Greene?
I'm with Captain Hamilton.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
You know very well who it is that I love.
But not more than your comfort.
George, I'm sorry.
Where... do those men come from, George?
They can use their imaginations.
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre.  I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
You are a slave owner!  You have been illegally surveying lands beyond the Ohio Valley!  That land belongs to the natives!
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Cat, that's the lamest idea I've ever heard.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
You see the paper?
Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
After this one, I'm out, Cat, you understand? This is the last time we talk to each other.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
No. What's this?
I don't know how I could've missed you with that shirt on. It's the same as the other one you had only the hibiscus are a different color. Right?
What're you hanging around with a guy like that for? You were in the movies, right? A stuntman? What's he ever done he can talk about? You feel okay?
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
What's this movie you're doing first?
You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
She's... young.
You know how to write one of these?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
In just a second. Two...
You know Laurel Canyon?
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Last night. When he called me over to your office to talk about it.
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
What three hundred grand?
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
Who the fuck are you?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
You live in Miami?
I'm a producer.
By the way, you recall the number of the locker you used?
Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
Leo spanked a waitress?
I'm looking at you.
You make movies, huh?
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
Maybe a few times I have.
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
One of his best parts.
Just a thought.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
I had to tell 'em something.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?
Hey, Harry.
Is he giving you a check or cash?
Really.
You have it?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
Yeah. That was a good party.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
So you want to know.
One of mine?
Like this?
Wait. How about this?
How about this?
That's not bad.
I believe it.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
I'm up twelve grand today.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
You broke in?
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons -
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
You thought I was faking?
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
You sure?
Karen! What the fuck are you doing?!
Were you scared up there?
What took you so long?
Yeah, the guy owes Momo a few G's.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
I'm thinking about producing.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
What a spectacular view.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
You don't? What happened to Muff?
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Lufkin. His... agent.
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
That's what it says.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Let's not be too hasty.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
What day is it?
The turbine blew.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
One more?
What is your first name?
Maureen.
What?
You think that's funny
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
What're you crazy?
Maybe that is his boat.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Dodge.  Dodge.
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
The right way and the wrong way.
But how long?
What about running number two by itself?
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
Three, four days.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
That'd be my guess.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
Don't lie to me!
What the hell happened!
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Morning everybody.
That's a good thing?
Coffee.
Any dizziness?
Coffee?
So what did happen?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Murphy to Epps.
Epps.
Greer?
He needs a doctor.
If they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
The ah... the radio's out.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
February first.
What do you think happened on this boat?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Not our mystery guest again.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Epps? You there?
Over the gold.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
We hit land.
What?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
How's that?
Murphy, goddamit.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
I don't know.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
You don't remember?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Oh, man.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
He took the shotgun and a light.
What about the gold?
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
As I said, what seems to be the trouble?
What's this?
That cost me twenty grand at least.
I have some good news for you, Pumpkin.
Pumpkin, are you in there?
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
Hmm.
...wow...
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
That guy rules!
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Nothing.
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
God, what a bunch of retards...
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Hi.
Okay, okay!
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
What is this?
What are you talking about -- who?
Why do I always have to do it?
I want to "make love" to him.
SHUT UP!
What's going on now? What's he doing?
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Gross!
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
What are you talking about?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
We still have to go in there sometime.
Let's go hassle Josh.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
I'll bet he never jerks off...
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
You won't believe it! Guess!
Just now... I went with Seymour.
That rules!
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
What? When did you see Josh?!
Nothing.
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
It's fine.
That's all you're bringing?
What time?
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Wow... finally.
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
Nothing.
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
A mongoose... they eat snakes... you never heard of a mongoose?  That's a classic piece of vintage taxidermy. Nobody alive today knows how to do work like that.
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
Norman.
...are you waiting for a bus?
I did too!
Hey, where are you going?
Indian records?
Those are all 78s... Can you play 78s?
Is this one any good?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Wow!
Oops! I dropped it!
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Jesus!
I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
So is that your boyfriend?
Well are --
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Relax, Seymour, relax...
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
What, are you a klansman or something?
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
For nineteen years...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
What? Why?
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
What is that?
What, like a girdle?
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
Uh... hello?
Oh, hi...
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
Well when can we do something?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
Can you at least let me in?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What's the matter?
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
I hate sports.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
What do you want?
Yeah, well... me neither...
But, I...
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
Yeah.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
Right, exactly!
No... they said she was here...
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
That slut!
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-  -there's nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is-
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
Starling?
This is supposed to be salvation?  What kind of idiocy are we dealing with here?
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it? It's only being built to control the ivory trade, make men richer.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
Not once?- you didn't hit it once?-
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
I hate to be a bother, John, but the cramp's getting worse.  The pain is actually quite unbearable now.
Shhh.
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
We need to talk.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
I can try.
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
Have you ever failed?
But of course yours worked.
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Where is it?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?
Everybody has a choice.
We don't have a relationship.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Do you ever see him?
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
I won't.
I have.  That's why I didn't call you first.
He didn't "ditch" me.  We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it.
He ditched you.  You should've married me, you know.
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
I'll do it.
That's where the buggy stopped.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
So this is what you do, huh?
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
I'm sorry.  Were you on your way out?
I don't know what to do anymore.
This is Joe Namath's old number, you know. You could get a lot of chicks with this. Just don't pee in it.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Maybe I should call Janine.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
What are you doing up here?
Have you made any plans yet?  You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
Can I have some of your water?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
That's a thousand million electron volts.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
This one's interesting.  Berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  Three hundred eyewitnesses.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Rivers of the stuff!
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
What's that?
I'm Ray --
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
Forget it.  The Vienna Boys Choir couldn't get through this stuff.
Vigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
That's it, Ray.  I've had it.  No more parties. I'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
Are you telling me how to drive?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Now where are you going?
Is it a star?
Ready?  What is it?
Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
You really don't act like a scientist.
You're quite a housekeeper.
I told you, I ...
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
All right.  What do you want to do?
Then leave.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
That is one speedy mutt.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Did you see it?  What was it?
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
In the physical sense.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
You could say that.
I'm not at liberty to say.
All right.  What is it?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
What on earth gave you that idea?
I'm always serious.
Don't cross the beams.
What do you mean "bad?"
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
Set entry grid.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
They will.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Third floor.  Get down here,
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Stantz?  You okay in there?
For the gods, spit it out!
Tribuus... tomorrow.
Where have you been?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
I want that bastard dead!
I am their hero!
Not yet, dear brother...
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience?
I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
I'm serious.
Gladly, Caesar.  And, if you'd like we can take you for a tour of the front at first light.
"Caesar Commodus discovering his lineage converges with the Demigod, Hercules, has determined to display his magnificence before his beloved citizens."  The Emperor's going to fight in the arena.  I'm supposed to write this for tomorrow's edition.
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
But have never been?
The Senate too?
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
You know our two most senior Senators:  Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
Would that Marcus had lived.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
Tomorrow?
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
This is our oil from our estates?
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
Quintus is overly idealistic.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
I killed too many barbarians.
General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant.
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
You get to come alive again in the country!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Do you want some dinner?
No -- why should I?
Could you do it?
Will you take me home now?
But could I just tell you this one thing?
Wait a minute.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Yes.
You do?
That woman --
That woman. The older woman.
Is that him over there?
No.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
What?
What do you think?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Because it isn't true.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
Don't you have it on?
Are you going home?
Benjamin?
I don't know.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
I don't see how we can.
I'll think about it.
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
The day after tomorrow?
Ben!
You a student?
What?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Yes.
Could you bring it up?
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
Where are you?
What?
A room. I'd like a room, please.
A single. Just for myself, please.
How are you, Benjamin?
What?
Why not?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
When is he coming back?
Sit down, Benjamin.
No.
Pardon?
What?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
It's all right.
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I know that. But I'm --
What are you so scared of?
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
What if he did?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Would you like me to seduce you?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Don't be nervous.
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Let me out!
Yes.
Hello, Benjamin.
May I have a drink?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I haven't. No.
Do you want me to get it?
I got a single room.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Well.
Benjamin.
Why don't you watch?
Will you bring me a hanger?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Is this -- what?
Are you tired of it?
Anything. Anything at all.
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
You're not interested in art?
Can I take off my clothes now?
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
What do you say to him?
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
We're talking.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
No.
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Man, is this interesting.
No.
Don't tell Elaine.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
Oh no. In the car you did it?
What?
Don't talk about Elaine?
Do you understand that?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Good.
I have my reasons.
Benjamin?
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Then you'd better start believing me.
What have you done to her?
I'll find her.
I say I've got it.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
When I go off?
I drive around.
I do.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Well --
I guess -- about my future.
I don't know. I want it to be --
No.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
No. She doesn't know about it.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Thank you.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
I know.
Ben, can I say something to you?
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
I will.
Mr. Robinson?
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Yes?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
The pearls are in her room.
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
No --
No -- no -- no -- no...
I don't like your tone.
With the pearls?
What about the money?
I have an idea working in my head... 
You might find a bullet through that head...
Who?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Have you seen it?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Dictation.  You know...
No -- why? -- should I?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Very little.
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
You're very funny --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Chasing what?
I feel sorry for him.
Oh!
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Nothing -- only to be here.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
What can you see?
I want to be alone.
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
You do believe that I really love you?
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Very early in the morning.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Not at all, sir. 
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
You've lost everything?
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Telegrams?
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
What, Doctor?
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
A man might what?
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
You're trembling.
Really?
You don't understand that do you?
Later?
No -- only occasional jobs. 
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover...
What?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
What?
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Oh, yes.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
No water -- What a place!
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Sorry, Preysing. 
You've decided against the merger?
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
I wish to be alone.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
Again?
I don't know you.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
What is this insolence?
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Just one moment, sir.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
What's the matter with you?
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
Hi, Bobo.
My son --
My son was in the hospital --
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You're calling the shots.
You ever hear about the oranges?
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
And if you do it wrong?
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Right in front of the room.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
So here we are!
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
Well, make it stop!
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
Kaggs. Home office.
Roy Dillon.
Well, uh... No.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
Up to you.
You don't put up with that! Nobody has to put up with that!
I tripped over a chair.
What's that?
You ought to put a bandage on that.
Going somewhere?
I just came back from Phoenix.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I've really got to --
Myra followed you, huh?
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
What?
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
I don't?
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
A future. The only future I've got.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
There's nothing more to talk about.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
Look at me.
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
Every day in every way.
No.
You already went back to work.
I'm a salesman.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
The long end. Big con.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
Is that right?
Atascadero.
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
She didn't see you, in other words.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
What?
I don't think I need it.
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Sure. Let's get it over.
Mr. Simms.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
No thanks, I'm not thirsty.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Only the real stiffs.
I can be real stiff.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
... I think it would be best if you both left.
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
No.  Wait for the police.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Where are you going?
He found you, didn't he?
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Shelve the barf bag.  It's the key to the main gate.
Where'd you get it?
You stole it?
Why not?
What are you doing here?!
I can see that.  Why?
I'm okay.
Better?
Linda!  He killed Linda!
It's John, isn't it?
This kid just wants his freedom.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
What?
Who?
Michael Meyers.
Better her than me.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
You're so easy...
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
But the dance is in the gymnasium.
Let the party begin.
Why?  You interested?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
But I've seen him!
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
Where's the baby?!
I hope you didn't come all the way out here in this storm just to quote Freud.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
Miss me, baby?
I dunno, boy.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Home is important to a man.
Um.
I suppose.
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
Go home!
First Nagasaki--now this.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
Go to the funeral?
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
I dunno.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
Go live in a safe-deposit box--with your things. LOOSELEAF Jesus--I wouldn't want to be married to him.  You know?
What's this?
You did?
Maybe it's time you got out.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
How are you, honeybunch?
I wanted to apologize.
I forget mine for years on end.
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
You're hollow, like a woman.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
You're my buddy.
Out!
Sir?
Dr. Woodly.
Is anybody besides you here now?
He worships Father.
Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper?
They were in the same creative writing class.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Tell me some true stories about Dad.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
England?
Uck.
We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time.
Mhravitch.
The name will live forever.  It was there that Harold Ryan slew the Beast of Yugoslavia.  Mhravitch.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
Penelope!
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
That's a rifle you have?
Can I help you, sir?
Sir?
Daughter--I love you very much.
How do you do?
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
Disease?
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
Your old beau?
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Nothing would please me more.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
I did?
Turn around?
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
I have some change!
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
I should have torn that door off its hinges.  Should have scrogged her ears off.  Should have broken the bed.  What do you want?  Well?
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
That's what you're supposed to say.
Go on.
His most cherished possession?  His violin, I guess.
Yes.
And no one's there now?
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
What are you going to do?
I came for my clothes.
He cried.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
Rifle?
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Blue soup?
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
If he thinks he's man enough.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
I plan to live one hundred years!
I mean it!
How do I load?
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Ahh--then she's still alive.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
And her fianc!
I feel the same way.  What next?
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
You've been bitten by bats?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
We have, have we?
This is man to man.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
You're old--so old.
You're a son of a bitch.
I haven't told you, Harold, how comical I think you are.
I'm high as a kite.
Cut me open.  Find out.
With spittle?
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
Don Quixote.
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
The new hero is you.
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
Don't shoot.
Get up.
No.
It's trash now, like mine.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
Alice got married again.
For what?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
Thank God!
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
No.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
You're the only woman he ever took out.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
I was afraid to ask.
Don't know.
That man is your father.
I don't get it.
That's why I'm crying.
Then get him.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He isn't any friend of Father.
He isn't?
He is my father.
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
Something happens to my confidence.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.
What then?
The park!
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
A what?
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
Did you talk to Paul?
Possibly.
Marry me instead.
Take plenty of cigars.
We made the date three months ago.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
As long as he keeps out of the park.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
It's an experimental model.  He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
Me, too.  I know something not even the police know--what's in the park at midnight.  Nothing.  Or, when I'm in there, there's me in there. Fear and nobody and me.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
It's a jungle out there.
You fool, you fool.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
It's good.  Let him go.
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
You mean I'm black?
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
There's no evidence of any foul play at present. I hope she's just a runaway.
What are you doing?
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
No.
Yeah.
You're still dressed?
Well, I want to...
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
What do you mean?
That's cool.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
I don't know no Tod.
Man, how many girls do you need?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Are you sure it's all right?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
No.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Three hundred?
Half now, half later.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
I thought you were going to bed?
Huh?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
No.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
And your wife? Where's she?
She's dead.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
Is that the way it was with you?
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
They were here?
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
Where does he live.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
What makes you so sure?
Why do you say that?
Did you find out where she was?
But then you'll forget about me.
Andy.
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Hello?
In G.R.? Why?
Where is she?
I don't know.
But the police...
The police? They know less than you do.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Yeah, sure.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
How's your business, Jake?
Wes, do me a favor.
Just do what I say. Don't ask.
What is going on?
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
Where does he hang out?
I don't know.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Okay.
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
But I...
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
In other words, you want to get laid?
Not exactly...
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
What's that?
I've been on another case. All day.  I suppose I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
You can fuck off, too.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
No.
You are at the University, Candy?
And what are you studying?
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Lady, let me get this straight.
Haven't we met before?
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
Possession of a stolen shovel.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Edith was just telling me about her job.
A block of ice.
Here's your shovel.
Eh, no. Thank you.
Nice to meet you.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
All right.
Eh, fine.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
What do you think?
You look as if you could.
What is it?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Well, I really don't drink...
What's that?
No.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I don't know.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Well, why don't you?
No. I'd feel stupid.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
Maude, I must speak to you.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
How about some candy floss?
Yes. They're old friends.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Why?
It's all right. It's organic.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
It's true. I can't live without you.
What?
I don't care what people say.
This is insane.
Oh, is this your father?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
No.
Yes.
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Yes.
Well, I don't...
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Oh yes. That's fine.
Yes.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
I knew you'd come.
You knew?
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
What's the matter with her?
God, that's terrible.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
And you're sure it was a woman?
Get out of the way.
O.K. Let's go.
What are you talking...
I'm scared.
Well... G'bye.
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
I need to touch it to "see"...
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Story of my life.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
hound of resurrection --
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
You are a Catholic??
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
The freak in the gas mask --
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
Do you believe in hell?
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
C'mon -- Rasputin??
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
I thought you liked being on TV.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Sir, may I go first??
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
I knew those men better than you did --
No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it, walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins, K-boom! Easy to clean, easy to use...
No. Don't --
Helping you -- I just --
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
You want me to hold him down?
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
What was that??
Where do you --
Anything else you --
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
Alone?
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Out? Out out?
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
I like that...
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
He -- loves you.
What about you?
It's freezing, isn't it?
Just take it slowly.
That your daughter?
Who are you?
Many times.
Please. Get back into bed.
I don't remember.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.
This isn't happening.
No.
Oh my God.
Poor baby.
Julia.
Don't look at me.
Help me.
Tell me who you are.
Back from where?
What do you want me to do.
I'm hurting
Poor Larry. Obedient as ever.
You're hurting.
What?
Let me see.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Maybe we should just leave --
What's the problem?
This afternoon.
It's ONE of these.
Like who?
Just a thought --
Not exactly modern.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
Shit.
So damn stupid.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Sure.
I'll be down in a minute
Are you all right?
-- I'll go see.
Oh baby.
What are you talking about?
What?
Please.
I suppose that's right.
You want something to drink?
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
This isn't the bedroom.
Oh Christ.
What's wrong?
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
Take care, Dad.
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
Maybe you should give it some time.
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
I don't believe it.
Yes!
PLEASE. You're in danger.
Not that late.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
I beg your pardon?
What's wrong?
Rob.  Rob Gordon.  Circa junior high...
You gotta be kidding me.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
We'll do it next Monday.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
What do you mean, "what?"
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it.  Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Hey.
What band?
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
What's up?
Laura.  Her dad died.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
Whatever.  Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Fuck off, Barry.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Haven't seen it.
Laura said we could.  If we helped out with the posters and stuff.  And we did.  And we are.
Great.  Can I have it then?
I have all of the others.
What?
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Don't do it, Rob!
Where's Rob?
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Right.  Why?
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Fine.  That's great.
Sure, but is that it for the list?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Nice friend.
Yeah.
What's his name?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
'Morning, Dick.
Great.
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
I understand, Dick.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
It's Vince and Justin.
Maybe I should talk to him.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
What's the obvious stuff?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
Just ask it!
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
I told you I slept with him.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
That bad, eh?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you?  I mean, how much are you making now?  Sixty? Seventy?  And you were living in this shitty place.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
Those aren't mine.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
I guess I am.
I can't talk right now.
Who the fuck's Pig?
I'm sorry.
No, no.  When are you going home?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
You're soaking.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
What do you mean?
What do you want to do?
What?
What it was like.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
How?  How were we the same people?
But what?
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
You're tougher.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
You're being stupid.
Hi.  What are you doing?
Where?
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
Just local, of course.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
I'm going to talk to you.
I know.
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
What's the -- hey, Liz --
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I'm sure it isn't.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Yeah.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
Hi, Mom.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
What do you think?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
But you must have --
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Look... I... I'm sorry.  I don't want to be any part of this.
Seventy-five.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
I'm Vince.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
Yeah.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
Figured you knew more about swords than I did.
You're the expert.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Would you remember his name?
Do you play?
Someone beat you.
You have an active imagination.
He tried to kill me last night.
He called you "MacLeod".
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
You?
You are being foolish.
He sees me as a threat.
No one knows you're here?
You make it all sound so simple.
Yes.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.
It's beautiful.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
Yes.
I hope I never get that old.
Why are you here?
I see.
I'm not even sure why.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
You killed those other two.
Not the same.
What is it like?  Being you?
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
Gettysburg's an hour's drive at most.  You should be back by nightfall.
No!
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
I'm calling an attorney.
All fashionably without heads.
But there's more.  Wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in Felton, Delaware.  Some locals spotted two cars with D.C. plates and surprise surprise, they turn out to be registered to our own Brenna Cartwright and the ever popular Richard Taupin.
It'll never stick.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
I want Taupin.
What's all of this got to do with me?
I don't believe him.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
Stop.
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Your name is Conor?
Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
Aye.
I was driven out.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
You know me home.  Me name.
You feel you know me.
You are still so very young.
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
This can't be.
But we cannot be killed.
Me arm hurts.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
I do not think I like the sound of that.
But why be so concerned about me?
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
But I did live.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
Some think not.
Something pretty.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Wait.  I think we understand each other.
Don't threaten me, Private.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
Where did you learn that?
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Figure she's with him?
Are you sure?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Kahn?
How did you find me?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
What are you doing here?
And have you something to settle with me?
I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
You've been here from the start.
This isn't done.  Get up.
Tradition.
Leave her alone.
This your present address?
What are you getting at?
What were _you_ looking for?
Do you?
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
No.
Nothing to be sorry about.
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
Are you back?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Hello, Bensinger.
Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope.
Seventy-five.
Sort of a Jack London style?
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
What's the matter?
I lost my wallet.
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail...  I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
How's business, Bruce?
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
I'm beginning to realize that.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
The money? Why?
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
Call Duffy!
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
What do you want?
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Sure you can. Come on.
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You've had a better offer, eh?
You bet I've got a better offer.
I know, Walter, but I --
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Listen, Walter --
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless --  Hildy!
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Get away, Svengali.
I'm not working for any other paper!
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
What do you mean?
We're not interested.
What tricks would I pull?
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
Where do you think you're going?
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
I know, but --
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
Huh!
Is he coming back here?
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
What would you do if it was a daughter?
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Down Western Avenue. We were going sixty-five miles an hour. You know what I mean?
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
You got plenty of money?
Sure, boss.
I'm busy, Duffy.
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
How much?
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Boy, did you see her go?
So have we!
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
Take your paws off me!
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
What do I know about Williams?
Where'd you get this?
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
What is it?
We'll fix that, too. 
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
A sight for sore eyes!
I won't.
Got you, Williams!
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Five hundred dollars.
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me! 
Phone for you, Hildy.
There goes another scrub lady.
Any news?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Did you get that, Hildy?
Look out, you --
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Mother!
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
Don't forget about production for use.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
What's the idea?
Hey --
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
No, I don't think so.
For heaven's sake, why not?
Get out of here!
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
That was a googly!
But Grandpa, you said...
No, she didn't.
What's that?
My uncle's in the War Office. He said, Don't go on the bomb sites. "Boys are going missing all the time."
Yes.
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
Who with?
You're the biggest fibber.
Can't we just see the end?
It's like telling fibs.
Wow!
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
What about it?
There was talk of planting some when we first came.
We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.
We all had to write a last letter home.
What's that?
And what's that?
Well, it's off ration. We know that.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
That's it.
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
He always knows.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
It seems to have survived.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
I agree.
Drink up, it's party time.
Where's that?
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
What the hell are you laughing about?
He walks, duh.
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
But if you did.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Then the devil asks, "do you drink?" Guy says, "yeah"... devil say, "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks night, best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Really fucking awesome.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
She looks like she stinks.
What was that?
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
What's he so excited about?
Just grin and bear it.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Forget it. I'll just go.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
What I need are some answers. 
And...
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Huh?
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Yeah?
So what?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
I resign.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
You got to be fucking joking.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
Yeah, no mercy here.
You find something, Georgie?
What do they call you, sweety?
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Sorry.
Fuck you, you fucking freak!
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Please, just a minute.
What should I do?
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Mr. Willis?
That's it?
Aw, fuck.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
I guess not.
Over.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
And?
It's embarrassing, okay?
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
French?
Oui.
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Of course not.
No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Fine.
Not in front of the boy.
My little French.
Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
Like what?
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
God, you're beautiful.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
He's dead.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Progress!
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Always. Ow.
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
What do you mean?
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Won't he be able to tell?
One night stand?
No. I married a midget.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Be still my crotch.
Please, honey, let me in.
I don't know, honey. I don't know. Maybe he just didn't want to get involved.
I'm going to miss you.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
You are a therapist, right?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
I'm not sure.
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
I'm sorry?
What are you doing in there?
I'm sorry about my parents.
Do you?
Shaving cream?
Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion?
I don't know. Something.
Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies!
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Your entire body?
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
That's great. It's a great color for you.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Have you?
Bravo to you, Puff!
So he's doing okay?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
Shit.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Aha! Finally. I've covered almost the entire seaboard and parts of eastern Ohio.
Ooka.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Extra dessert?
Thanks to you, Nate.
Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
No, I'm fine.
I'm ready.
And a fact is a fact.
To win.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
That's the way it's done.
Could be.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Make it twenty.
Thought you only drank milk.
Yeah? Why?
What is?
Pool.
Character.
Yeah. Sure, sure.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
What's that supposed to mean?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
I told you. I got drunk.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Seventy-five per cent.
For who?
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Hi. How's business?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
I been thinking.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
How good is he?
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Sure.
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
Half.
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
What's your game? What do you shoot?
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
The expensive kind.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Why?
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
It's quiet.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
How do you feel?
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Eddie...
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
A son.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
Yeah, to play Fats again.
Would you like to come out tonight?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Hi.
You're a pretty good player.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
You better not miss, friend.
Long wait for a bus?
Have a nice trip?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
No, not always.
You don't look like a college girl.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
I could always get us a bottle.
No.
Why did you do that?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
What time is it?
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
You told me.
Okay. So what's your name today?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
You want to go with me?
What did all this stuff cost you?
Do you want me to go?
Give it to me.
Well, what's so funny?
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
He went off someplace.
Go on back to the hotel.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
You lived like this once.
What about... now?
With them?
Yes.
Who is this?
What choice did I have -- ?!
What's inside?
Humans.
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
So, what do you do?
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
Why, Dad?
There are more this year than last.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I was so scared.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I left it at work.
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
Where, Jimmy?
No.
Damn.
What is it?
But you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
David? How'd you get this number?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Just my luck, no ice.
I take it you've heard.
Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close?
He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two.
Spunky. He told you about that?
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
I don't know how you put up with him.
You saved a lot of lives.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
Yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. When I find the exact binary sequence and I apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer I built you last Christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
Strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. The signal reduces itself every time it recycles. Eventually it will disappear. Are you listening?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Then what?
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
Three years.
You still got the Olds?
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
Spunky?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
It's Air Force One for crying out loud. Still he gets sick?
I'm making a mess.
What'd I say?
What the hell are you doing?
Get us out of here!
We're loose!
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
Be careful.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
You're late.
You scared the hell out of me.
Dick-weed.
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
It's all fuzzy.
But I gave you some this morning.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
Above American soil?
Call them back.
Yes.
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Why did you people come here?
Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
Here... now.
And before here?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
My reputation precedes me.
May we go home now, please?
Marcus!  I did it!
All your life.
All my life!
But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
That doesn't look much like a library.
Dad was onto something here!
Henry! What are you doing here?!
What?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Schneider?
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
That was our assessment as well.
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
Yes?
DONOVAN!
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
It must be one of these...
At least I let you tag along.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
All I have to do is squeeze.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Dad!
But what are you doing here?
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
Right.
Found it.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?
You did!!
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
No! Don't Shoot!
Umh?
Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Dad!
What?
Head for the fireplace!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.
And do I detect a rebuke?
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
This is intolerable!
Dad?
You call this archaeology?
Uh-huh.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
That car belonged to my brother-in- law.
I don't need camels.
Why are you trying to kill us?
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
All right! Where's my father
And why were you trying to kill me?
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Interested in local curios?
Charming.
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
You have insulted my son.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
No.
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
Why they glow like that?
Come one, what's wrong?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
For crying out loud, a kid's driving the car?!
I'm freezing. What do you mean, tag along? From the minute you walked into that nightclub, you haven't been able to keep your eyes off me.
He told me they knew I was coming here.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
Not leftovers?
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
WILLIE?!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
I can't!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
And they don't even know what it really is.
My name is AL.
Who?
You're in my head...
I just got here.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Yeah?
Where are we now?
You've heard of the PEM114...
Me? What'd I do?
No.
Kill myself.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
Why he's argumentative?
What was that?
I'll talk to them.
I'll tell you what to say.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
What'd he look like?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
Too late...They want you.
They could put you back in the tube..
Door's locked.
Who did?
I'm at the airport.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
We get on a plane.
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
I'll get in trouble.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
The beach.
Eating sushi?
You eat it.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
What? What do you mean?
She's...pretty fast.
Which language?
Where is she staying?
Touch her.
I made it work.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Rene...
Well you did it today.
It is my business. It's my name.
Which one is she?
What glasses.
Follow that busboy.
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
He recognises you, throw him off.
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
I don't know!
You been had. We have.
Some agent you are.
You found her.
Osaka.
Just stay here and rest.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
Yeah...You've fallen for her.
You have to! Quickly!
Probably.
I've got an idea.
Left...The one with the red dot.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
And Dieter?
This may hurt.
I can always flush you down the toilet.
Rene?
She works for them.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She is beautiful.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
I'll get us out of here.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
JOE What abilities...?
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
What part what?
What is your name?
Can you fly this?
What happened?
It's a long story.
Me.
No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
How about a deal?
You have nothing...
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Who is your friend?
What are you doing here, where've you been?
He's not an ordinary man.
When you do...
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
You'll feel better
Take the card.
Who?
Ahhh...nothing.
I noticed you staring.
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
How's that Trucklhouser Beer?
What do you want?
Nothing.
Is someone else here?
...Blake
...right here too.
I can't do that?
Let you leave without it.
I waited for you.
It's not apparent.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
Why do you do it?
Trans Ocean Travel.
And you, what do you like?
Joe! What happened to you?
They kidded me a little.
There's not much to tell.
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
You work for Ryuji?
No.
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
Why?
What'd he steal?
A chip. Goes in a computer.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
You don't believe me.
Who was?
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Now what?
Hong Kong.
This going to work?
What a mess.
What?
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
Just like that?
I'll come back for you.
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
Kiss her you fool.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
You are, I've seen you.
He told me what to do.
That's twenty feet high.
What about the others.
It is?
I can't get it out. It would take hours.
It'l be alright.
What's new?
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths.
Instant rice...?
Three hours.
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
P.J.'s.
Push it.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Alright, alright.
When's the air date?
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
Maybe later.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk!
What the hell are you doing?
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
I'm not touching my film...
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
No, no, we're fine...
What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?"
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
How are you, Jim?
Hi, baby.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Uh, what are those boxes?
Right now?
That's my stuff from the office...
Why? Who said?
What's going on?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Who's calling?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
Yeah.
No classes this morning?
Will independent sources corroborate that?
What's wrong?
Jeffrey Wigand...
...you fucked me!
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
We're there.
You eating with us?
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
Who are these people?
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line!
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
Alright. What did you think?
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Mike... in my...
Coffee?
How have you liked your stay?
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
You believe that?
No.
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
Jeff...
Lowell, I can't afford --
You attract a crowd.
Yeah, great.
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
ABC Telemarketing Company.
That's not the point.
You greased the rails!
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
What?
What's happening?!
He doesn't seem to be listening...
Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...!
I can't say that!
Where you staying now?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Right.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
A delivery device for nicotine.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
Object to the form of the question!
It acts as a drug on the body?
Object to the form!
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
That's why we hire scientists...
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
He --
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
You did good, Massey!
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
So she's uh, flourishing?
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Who's the pigeon?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
You want Botox?
No frown lines.  New watch?
It was a gift from a client.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
Thanks, buddy.
I have it.
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
How do you know?
Why would you be here?
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same?  I assume you're a carnivore.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
You don't believe in it.
Gotcha.
What is it you're after, Miles?
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
So I hear. Is that all?
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
To victory.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
What is it Miles?
I want to be your -- your wife.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Did you just propose to me?
Yes.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
I know.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Fabric and fringe.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
Hi.
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
I want to nail you ass.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
It's a no go, Joe.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Income tax evasion?
Murder?
Sweet.
Rex. Get away from the door.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Hello, Rex.
Do you need a Tagamet?
Who's that?
Forgery and Fraud?
You used his credit card.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Miles Massey.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Yes?
Excuse me?
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
What?!
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
And it's good!
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
Ah.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
I'm not sure.
She always looked out for me.
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Hi, Sweetie.
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Three is not Farrow.
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in
What ten thousand?
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
That's an evasion.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
Where are you taking me?
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
You only met him once .
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Ellie
I knocked several times.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
On the road.
No.
Who is he?
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Oh, nono.
I'm sorry you read it.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
Why should she? After all
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
It's my daughter! Go after her.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
Yes, sir.
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
Amateurs!
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
Me? Forget it, son.  I got millions.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
Whadda you want!
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Driver!
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram.
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
Are you talking to me?
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Hey, Brat!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Are you talking to me!
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
That, I suppose, makes everythinguhquite all right.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Who are you?
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
Where'd you say the showersand thingswere? 
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Must be the Spring.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Santa Claus?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Thanks, professor.
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
Next week "East Lynne."
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
Not as long as I'm alive.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
To New York?
No.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
This isn't "piggy-back."
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Oh, Peter 
What's got into you?
Thought you were hungry!
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Oh, no!
Amazing.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
You're forgetting you're married.
Congratulations.
No harm in your coming to see us.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Here's your ticket, ma'am.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
What's the matter?  Where's your husband, young lady
Why, he'll be back.
But can't you wait until morning
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Yes?
Get out of here!
Wait a minute, GordonI
Joe, listen
Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Yeah.
Well, I'll be
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
They're married all right. I just seen the license.
You send telegrams here?
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Not a minute!
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Zeke.  Git!
There's a seat over there for you.
Wife?
What's up?
Thanks. 
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Yeahwouldn't it?
Five G'sor I crab the works.
I can use a smart guy like you.
Whyno
Where do you live?
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
I don't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none of our business.  Let's keep this side of it quiet, shall we?
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Did he pay?
And Oswald?
Mario, Jose - they wear names like you and I wear clothes.  Today the name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie. I wish I could help you, Jim.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
Did he pay you for this?
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
Dave?
Calm down, Dave, what?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
What did they...
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Why?  What's wrong?
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Honey, you all right? 
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
I'll take them up to my mother's if it'll make you feel better.  Spend a week.  I'll change the locks, the phone lines, I'll even get a bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, get a hold of yourself.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
And if you're wrong?
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Post Office.
What are you driving at, boss?
I can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
How many men?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy fired them both.  Cabell was his deputy for nine years.  Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop.  Now we'll have to subpoena them, Lou.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
I sometimes feel things've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed, Senator.
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
Are they?  Why would they?
How much more?
Clay something, that was his name - Clay.
The assassination, Jack?
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Germany.
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
That sounds fun.
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
This looks pretty good on me.
But then you told her you were home.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
I need a favor.
That requires me goin' out tonight?
A bit.
You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
I found out.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Great, you're here.
What's going on?
She sound scared?
She almost sounds scared.
What's she willing to give us?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
You have the right to say "no." And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant. And if I don't want to go through all that trouble, I could just take you in on suspicion.
Help yourself.
My pocketbook.
What's this?
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
How was your flight?
Fine.
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
You gain weight?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
You know who put the dope in your bag?
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Cash poor?
Ask A.T.F. They might give you permission.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
How'd you find that out?
He came by.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of done it, I did it to feel better about myself, and I do. When I look in the mirror it looks like me.
My ass ain't the same.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
He was here?
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
You know some interesting people.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
He tries to act cool.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
In a dress.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Uh-huh.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
I didn't say you did.
If I don't cooperate?
He say we like the same thing as married.
Yes'm.
Oh, Miss Brown?
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
Oh, so now you know him?
No.
You two meet?
Not really.
What did you say?
You didn't count it?
Uh-huh.
Where's the bag she gave you?
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
He said he didn't know about it.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
Beaumont Livingston.
Yeah?
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I understand woman, damn!
Yeah?
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
Plus the same deal as before.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
How do you know she did that?
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
She don't know shit about the money.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like?
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
How long?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
The roller disco one.
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
You lived in Japan, when?
Who's arm is that?
Must of made quite an impression.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
No.
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
What's your cost?
As low as two.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
I know you don't know. I said guess.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
An employee I had to let go.
Yep.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Uh-huh.
So what, you left her there.
You know how she is.
You shot her twice?
Uh-huh.
Where did you shoot her?
In the chest and stomach.
Louis?
You said five hundred and fifty!
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
You gonna tell me who it was?
How am I supposed to know that?
I'm going out for a few hours.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
How can I help you?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
Ten thousand sounds high.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
Haven't a clue.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Hey, Max.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
Somebody already did.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
She got off, huh?
What the fuck you doin' knockin on the door like the goddamn police? You lookin' to get shot?
I thought you might be asleep.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
Winston found you.
Uh-huh.
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
All I did was walk out with it.
And you did that to protect my interest?
That I gotta see.
She still is. She doesn't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened.
Have her bring the money here.
Call her, tell her the combination.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
She's all alone.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
You sure?
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Take me home.
What are you then?
I'm alive.
Let me out of here!
Remember?
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Dream on!
I see.
Just to see you. That's all.
I'm okay.
Daddy!
Oh God!
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
They're not interested, Jake.
I'm hanging up.
Wait ... Daddy.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
He say what they looked like?
You think they're connected?
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
How do you know?
Her knee acting up?
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
I had this weird flash just then.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
What are you doing?
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
I don't know what to say.
Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
Whataya mean, no record?
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
Guilty thoughts. See what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
Your kid dropped it off.
Who? Jed?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Jake, you are never out of your head!
What?
Is that the one who died?
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
Those guys tried to kill me tonight. They were aiming right at me.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
We're at Della's.
Show me Della!
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Don't gimme that.
Lie down!
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
He did? When?
What? What do you mean?
It's just me.
Jezzie?
I want to know. You tell me!
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Me neither.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
WHO ARE YOU?
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
Then don't bug me.
Mid-town mostly.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
West.
Where's West? New Jersey?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
What is it?
I don't know.
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
I would have stayed there if I could.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
Push 'em back.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Total delirium.
He'll never make it.
I'm sorry.
Nothin' much.
I need to see you, Jake.
I work in a bakery.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
I don't know.
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I don't know what to do.
What do you mean?
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
Oh God. I know. I know.
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
A car accident.
Is he all right?
He doesn't like it.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
On top of him?
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
Okay, enough of this shit.
I don't have all day, kid.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
What are you doing?!!
Where the hell were you?!!
Better let me.
Shit!
We're not supposed to do that.
Thorgan, suit up.
Where is...?
Boeman, the ships not here.
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Where is he?
Kicker, anything?
Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!
Give me a break! What happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo.
Where are you going?
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!
Hey.
What's this?
That's why I'm here.
I couldn't save them.
See? We're not so bad.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
I think I had some when I was eight.
It's time.
Spunky . . .
Well?
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
I...I don't know what I did...
You lost the charge?
Close the fucking door!
And what's with the headgear?
This is what it means right here.
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
Later.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
You killed him?
The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back.
I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
Ow!
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
I missed you too.
I don't understand...what does he want?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Guys, please come with me!
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
What have you done?
Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me.
Can we get through these?
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
Just a favor for your old man.
You got it.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
Who's driving the boat?
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?
You got it?
I never saw one that big.
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
That's it! Radio in for help!
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one!
Sexy, hm? What was I before?
How come you have to tell them that?
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
She's right.
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
Maybe we can save August...
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught...
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
What is all this stuff?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
Christine what?
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
What have you got there, Lenny?
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off.
I've got all these signs here...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Let it go, don't waste your time.
I'm okay...
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
He's heading under -- !
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state.
You know how I feel about her.
Cool.
I don't know...
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
But you copy my work every week.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Jesus, Bleek.
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Yeah, well... I still have your underwear.
Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Mine too.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You should grow a moustache. You're a real man now.
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Hon, did you get expelled?
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
No.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
We don't even have a dog!
Wow, dream big!
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
No.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Blood and guts.
Oh. That's, uh, my room. Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff.
Oh.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Yeah.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Like what?
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Vanessa. Shit, you better get out of here.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Cold feet.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Consider it your musical education.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
I actually know this one.
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
Then what's going on?
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Juno? What's going on?
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
You're pregnant?
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
Yeah, she does.
Yeah, like people in love.
Either I just pissed my pants or...
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
Only the one in my pants.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Aw, please Junebug?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
You don't say.
Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married.
You guys are playing music?
They're yellow.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
What?
She answered our prayers.
We're actually, finally doing this?
Looks like it, yeah.
You lose!
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
No it is not!
Do what?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
Early, what're you doin'?
...thank you.
...I don't know.
Tight fit.
Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
This the book your writing?
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Ya see what I'm sayin'?  Ha!
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
So tell me... what happened here?
...and?
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
So how's it going?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta "Deliverance."  "Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!"
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Up yours.
...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
All set?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Why, what did he do?
What are you going to do?
What about you?
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
His Parole Officer.
Where would we find him?
How old you?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
You're clean.
What do you think?
Well, how was it?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Yeah.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Are you hungry?
What for? That guys a dick.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
You think?
78th.
Telly.
It's no big deal, right?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
I don't understand why you do that.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Right.
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
What?
Sup then? Sup?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
I'm nervous.
I just know. I know you'll love it.
Who are they?
What is it?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
You know what I want to do?
What do I want to do?
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
Because your a virgin?
Why is that?
I wouldn't believe it?
Telly is at Steven's?
Yeah.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Sorry.
Everything is wrong.
No.
Yeah?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
You still mad at him?
The pain. The fucking pain!
You are being ripped open.
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Passion...
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Just a lot of crazy shit.
Uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
Yep.
Yep.
You know what it's like. It's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
Oh shit.
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Yeah.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
I hate 'em.
Yep.
Mom.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
You want a wip-it?
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Slow.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
It was... it was.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
We seem to have a little problem here?
What kind of problem?
Casual.
You are!  I don't like you.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
Morpheus.
What?
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
No.
You got it on the board.
Then let's narrow it down.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
I'm positive.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
What are you talking about?
Local?
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
You still having a problem with this?
We've checked.  There's no one with the last name of Emma on the Island.
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
What is it?
What do you mean, stand out?
Hello, Peter.
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
You'll find her.
You know her?
I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
I'm just trying to play the game.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
Have you any idea what the message is?
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
What?
What makes you think I was there?
Hello.
Very good.
Hello, Peter.
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
Yes?
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Very good.  How did you know?
What scars?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Why did he what?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
I know he really likes you.
How do you know that?  Did he say something?
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
For what?
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
He tapes their mouths shut.  We found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  We're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
Anything else?
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
As large as castles.
Did you see his face?
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
Another one?  What word did he leave?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
Answer the question.
Jeremy would have never killed himself.
Did you send the car?
We got a problem?
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Uh huh.
Are you one of the players?
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
It seems like such a complicated game.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
Do you always open quickly?
Well, I think I've had enough.
We need your help.
You sound like my mother.
It wasn't intentional.
How can you look at it so clinically?
Of course.
That's not fair!
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
You're not?
Relax.
No.
Why?
You know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
It was.
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
I just don't want to fight with you.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
I'm hungry.
Fine.
Did you call?
Nothing.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
Hi.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Because I know what it says.
How did you know it was "carefully"?
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
You're going to be late for your match.
Are you going to come tonight?
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
That's worse.
<u>What</u>?
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
The new Queen lives.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
You have rope?
You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
What do you see?
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
There is no other way. You asked me why the Beast had come this time.
Lyssa? <u>Why</u>?
Like you, she has extraordinary powers. He would make her his Queen.
I chose the wrong passage.
She can see the Beast!
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
I can. Because I choose it.
Slayers!
Do not let the waters touch you.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Let me comfort you.
You will not, then?
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
What business?
Your kingship ... your lord high mightiness ... when I called you a ... a ... whatever I called you, I didn't realize that you were ... were ...
I have need of friends.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
To the place where Death lives.
I'm not hungry.
You've eaten nothing.
These we'll pay for.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
My heart stays here.
What? Now you poke me in the nose as well?
Passable, pimple, very passable.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
I can't hold the weight of both of you!
He is the King.
Freylag's stronghold?
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
It is important to assure the succession.
I knew.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.
You were attacked in the forest?
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
Modred! Impossible!
The new King.
You know the voice.
Can you see?
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
Her name is Death.
Each to his fate, lad.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
I was beautiful then.
You had a son.
Where is he? My son.
Do not try your trickery on me!
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
It will not help.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
...What?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Yeah.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
...Not at all.
Take...
Well, I don't need them...
OK, I'm fine.
130... 140...
How can you say it?
What's up? I don't feel you're concentrated.
Why?
Stop. Everyone is looking.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
Poor darling, and then?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
...Yes?
Huh, that's good!
You can't sit here like that.
Huh? Why?
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
...OK... Good.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
He probably just went somewhere.
What is it?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
I have new dreams now.
It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do.
Are you two planning kids?
Maybe later.
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
A.P.B.... He isn't breaking any law.  He's a grown man... He can crawl on his hands and knees to China if that's what he wants to do.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
Can it kill me?
We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
Pardon?
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
You do?
Okay.
You thought I sent them?
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
Why do you polish that thing all the time?
Walk with me?
I want children.
Where?
Why there?
What did they ask?
To where?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Why?
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Red flag, man.
Not our problem.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
A marriage certificate?  Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
Well, hello.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
What was that?
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Michelle, breathe... that's it, what is it, talk to me.
You're amazing.
They called her 'Lizy' in the book...  Sorry I was late.  My jeep died on the way over from the paper.
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
When are you leaving?
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
Phileas Fogg?
She knew you loved her.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
I missed you Kris.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Are they standing?
What, come on?
Don't do this.
In a hospital.
What do your friends call you?
I need your help.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
Good morning.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
This isn't right.
What are my choices?
No alcohol?
No.
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
Want a drink? I'm having one.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
If I was I'm sorry.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
What's up?
This is the home of an angel.
You OK?
Yes.
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better.  Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
When?
What do you mean?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
Will you lighten up, please?
There are limits.
Where are you staying?
I've been all right.
Where have you been staying?
Have you told anyone that I'm here?
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
I can't tell you.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Go to hell.
You're fired. I have new representation.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
It's so shameful...
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there?
Did you hear a shot fired?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Thank you.
I don't know.
No!
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
You ready?
No.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
What's the point?  Look at me.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
Too demure?
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.
Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan!
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Power yoga?
Good luck.
Don't ask.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
She's completely untrustworthy.
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
And you know this for a fact?
So?
The what?
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
I don't --  Do that stuff.
Back up. How do you know he's gay?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree?
What?
I got bangs!
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
And I fully support that.
No.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
No, silly. I go here.
You got into Harvard Law?
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Wow. You're a walking felony.
Now I am.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
I didn't mean --
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
In court. On opposing sides.
Yes.
Where?
A restaurant in Oakland. Where no one would recognize us.
Hovering?
What's the thing that always makes us feel better, no matter what?
There he is!
We come watch... we come watch...
Always.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
No more... please...
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art.  They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach.  The pain remains constant.
I don't expect you'd understand.
You're a beast!
What was that?  Did you hear that?
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
Friend Ogg.  Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
Honeythorn Gump, is it?  I've not seen your ugly face since you sold me a jug of cow piss claiming it was dragon's tears.
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
Faerie ring?
And if I cannot?
What!
You be our guest, Jack.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
Damn them!
The colt's still too small.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Whatever for?
Jenny Greenteeth said:  "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
What know you of fields of war?
Shhh!  Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Certainly understandable.
I should hope not!
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
Wait!
Wait, Jack.
Nay.  I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Aye.  We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
One more turn...
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
Can you save her?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
Did you bring me here to sup?
What weapon?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
I've not heard a note out of you.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
I was with the Princess.
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
You see!  You see!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Dolt!
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
Never.
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
Stop complaining.
I detest serpents.
What shall we do?
Shhh!
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Who?
My father and the Baron.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
Then, perchance you'll me.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
What have I done?
No!  I won't let it happen...
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Pinching?  Where?
Everywhere!  Ow!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Step lively now!
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Not very precise directions.
Exceeding fair.
As fair as me?
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Dead, dead, dead.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
I'd be honored.
Please...
Be fair, Oona.
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
What care the bones when the soul is free?
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
To Castle Couer de Noir?
A castle's but stone and mortar --
In a dream.
Marco!
What are you doing?
We did a lot of the wiring too.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
He hasn't called?
I put him to work.
What are you doing up so early?
I'm going to bed.
I'd be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
He must.
Can you keep Sam straight?
It's not what I was expecting.
Yeah.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
Why are you so stupid?
Why are you so uptight?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
Josh said...
Not really.
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
You hate your father.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
An exhaust system or a window is code.
I hate to ask about a window.
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
how much weight have you lost?
How's your wife?
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
She's out with a friend.
I'm sorry.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
I never said anything.  I haven't done anything.
I know what the deal is.  Josh is a pimp. I'm not stupid.
To check up on me?
Because I live there.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
I hate turkey.
It'll be fine.
Where are you going?
You're too fucking late.
The gloves on the table are for you.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
Hi, Alyssa.
What would you like to be?
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
Getting high, I guess.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
Sun glasses?
To hide a black eye.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
I don't wanna go, Sam.
I aimed high.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
I need you to do me a favor.
A blueprint spool.
What did you do with your dog?
Kurt's been feeding him.
I need to talk to you.
I was parked in day parking.
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Money?
Severance pay.  And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
The garage.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Last time you were gone for a week!
I used to live here.
I dreamed about your house last night.
Oh...with his ear infection!
Go in there and lick his attitude.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
I thought we were helping.
That was the truth.
Are you going to kiss me?
Don't move!
Been thinking?
Does Alyssa know?
Don't even...I'm there.
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
The biggest waste of time since television.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
After the kids are back in school.
What?
I was talking about our marriage.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
Sam took them to a movie.
You don't look like you.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
I've missed you guys.
No.
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
You're sure about this?
What did you say?
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Nigger.
And the baby?
He's a big one.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Is Spanky here?
Yeah...
Why not?
Take care of me?
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Cool it, Ray. You're gonna get us in a lot of trouble.
I got it... boss.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks!
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
Engagement ring!
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
That's because I've never been here before.
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Where they taking us, anyway?
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a word since we started. Least you could do is make some friendly conversation.
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
Why didn't you take it?
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
Reward?
Here I am.
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
So?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
You know what I'm saying.
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
On your behalf. What happened to we?
No.
I said you're soft.
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
I don't know. Who do you want?
I know people.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Crawfords.
Let it go, Claude.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Well, if that's the way it is...
After all these years of blissful silence, I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
What?!
Wilkins' driver's got the flu, so he asked me to fill in for him.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
You ain't getting out of that trunk.
You sure it was him?
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
I can't do it.
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
I can't eat this.
You didn't get ketchup?
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
How you doin'?
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
What is that?
Made just for you, Cookie.
He's from New York City. That one, too.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Move it out.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
What do you think about that?
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
They gave me life, mama.
Wait for the firemen!
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Hunting's been pretty good on the farm the last few years. It's one of the perks of the job. If you're interested, tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots.
Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Apparently, your sister died.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
What's your name?
What are you in for, Willie?
Goldmouth? They say he was born out back behind the shithouse. That's what they say.
What's the Boom Boom Room?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Blacks welcome there?
If you fuck me on this one, I'll spare no expense.
You shouldn't have come here.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
And he's dead serious.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
No!
Oh, Nicky, I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
How come you're not older?
Where did you meet my father?
How did you see me?
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I didn't murder anybody
Everything's fine, pop.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
You did it for Namath.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
How bad?
No. This can't be happening.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Bus?
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
Easy, Liberace.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
There's our man.
This don't look good.
Which way did he go?
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
Come on. One more time.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
You keep a bat under your seat?
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Hello.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
My dad's an optometrist.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
Sometimes, sure.
Valerie?
No.
What are you doing?
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Nicky!
Off limits.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
No.
It looks like the work of a brother...
A black guy?
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.
Answer the question!
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
I am.
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
Do you have anything special in mind?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
Had enough?
Just wondered... what happens?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
You missed something special.
Who invited you?
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
Why did you do that??!!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
I'm Mary 2.
Here.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
Maybe you'll think of something...
If you did know, you'd tell me.
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
Of course.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
He asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
And Sanctuary?
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
I'll make the arrangements.
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?
Not yet.
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
Oh... I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
Can you make it back?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
What's happenin'?
I'm, okay... You okay?
Maid? Relative?
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Might be a good time to try using it again.
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
You recognize that guy?
His or ours?
You know what I think?
I don't know.
Can I call you?
It's me...
I can't see you tonight.
Sure.
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
Pornos.
Pete... Don't...
In pornos?
Set.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Dick Laurent?
Better.
Yeah.
What's up?
The wife killer?
I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
No, sir, it's not.
Who is it?
When he went to work, right.
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
Do you remember?
A headache?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
There's no other bedroom?
What's bothering you, Madison?
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
I like to laugh, Fred.
What's that?
When you didn't come to the club.
What the hell is going on?!
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I... but... I don't remember.
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Beautiful! Smooth as shit from a duck's ass. Let's take a ride.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
At sixty?
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Pornos?
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
What?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Mr. Eddy?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Yeah.
At your house. Don't you remember?
We just killed a couple of people...
I missed you.
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't know.
Why don't you like me?
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
I was?
Sheila...
All of it?
I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
Fossils.
I'm a paleontologist.
I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
Uh-huh.
Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
I beg your pardon.
Why, of course. Yes.
It certainly is.
Look here
Oh, really?
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Where are they? Do you see them?
Yes!
Yeah? If this be execution, lead me to it.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Have I?
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
Charming chap.
It's better than freezing to death down below, isn't it?
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Gold. You were going to
Nothing. Why?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Cave, eh? Where?
Hey - look!
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
How do you do?
That's intelligent.
How do you deal with incorrigibles? Criminals?
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
But Mr. Chang, all these things - books, instruments, sculpture - do you mean to say they were all brought in over those mountains by porters?
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
You're startled?
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Charming, isn't she?
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
What do you want?
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
You know, it's very, very strange, but when you saw me in the corridor, I was actually on my way to you. I bring the most amazing news.  The High Lama wishes to see you, Mr. Conway.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Oh, I'm so glad.
We were just going to bury him when you came along.
Are you so certain you are away from it?
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
It's all your fault! It was all arranged until he spoke to you! Why can't you leave us alone?
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Sondra Bizet.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Mine?
Bob! I think I hear motors!
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
Yes.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Oh, stop it!
What is it?
Yes.
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
Porters?
Something grand and beautiful, George. Something I've been searching for all my life. The answer to the confusion and bewilderment of a lifetime. I've found it, George, and I can't leave it. You mustn't either.
So you think I'm mad?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
I'd go mad!
You're wrong, George.
You say the porters are waiting for us?
Where were you hiding?
Good.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
What do you suggest?
Why, you - you Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
Struggling, why?
Would you like to wring my little neck?
What do you want him to do?
What is it?
That's what I mean - mysterious. Mr. Conway, I don't like that man. He's too vague.
How about you? Do you want to go?
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
You shot an eight year old girl.
The hell were you thinking?
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Cowan--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
And Goodwill Toward Man?
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
Kay, listen, I dunno what got into--
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
What?  Who the hell are you?
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
We wear black.
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
What?
I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
Why did Mikey leave Nazca?
What's going on, Kay?
He's here to help!?
How does that help me?
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
What are you doing?
Would you call this a code 100?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
After I got the shit beat out of me!
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
What the hell does that mean?
No.
Yes.  Yes, that's eminently fair of you.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
They're not my pals--
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
Really nice wheels, by the way.
How's Dee?
He's gone, too.
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
They went right to the President.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
Anderton --
The other two will die without me.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
She grew up.
-- but he didn't.
About who?
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
That's comforting.
And replace them with new ones.
I put you away --
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How do I find the --
The nano... what?
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Hence the expression...
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
Yes, sir.
Lara called me.
I go running down there.
We won't let them.
And who the hell is that?
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
I'm not getting halo'd.
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
Uh, sir...
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
What?
Sir?
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Why did you catch that?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
To them.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Just a nickname.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
Flaws.
She was looking right at me.
I need help with her.
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
Are you reading my mind right now?
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Come on!
I wanted to.
Who are you?
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
The precogs were wrong.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
Something wrong?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Not if I stay away from him.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
The system would collapse.
You said they're destroyed.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Which one is that?
John?
He's dead, Lara.
I thought you were retiring?
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Tell him not now.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
I don't understand --
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
I wanna kill my boss.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
How many?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
What about your meeting?
We could have lunch together.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
This your work?
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
What are you talking about?
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Yeah.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
Yeah, snifters are for cognac --
Is it a good room?
Not on me, sir.
What, sir?
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I know.
Oh no. What is it this time.
We used to take baths together.
What the fuck was that about?
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
She's, uh, sleeping.
Chloe?
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
So, what kind of gig is this?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Take her.
But what about them?
Get your hands off of her.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
Well, you look it. You win?
What's up? Jess ready?
You driving her?
Yeah.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
How bad is it?
Troughed off. Protected. Like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
Where we going?
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Sure. Yeah.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
So, that's it. I'm out?
I didn't say that.
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
I don't want to drive another girl, Max. The only reason I'm --
Ruiz knows about this?
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
He'll work it off.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
Yes, for expenses and such. Now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. You each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. Am I making myself abundantly clear?
Yes.
What is it?
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
Jesus Christ, where the fuck you been all night? You look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
A bad heart.
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
What's that?
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Yeah?
I'm on the phone.
Ruiz isn't here.
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
What about boxing?
It's not losing record.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Don't be shitty.
Yeah. I know the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
Bullshit...
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
Fuck him.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
It's not even yours.
Nice work.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
It's ours.
How much is it?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
They asked who it was.
This is bullshit, man.
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
I don't know.
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
What did I 'get?'
So is this the drop?
Like I said, I don't know.
Where do you think you're going?
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
What the fuck was that about?
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Nothing, man.
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
We don't need guns.
It was six in the fucking morning.
You're out of money?
No.
Eighty bucks?!?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
Let's get some sleep. That's what we need, man. Sleep.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Let's just go now and wait.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
Bobby and Ricky.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
You want your surprise?
Yeah. I want it.
You want to come splash around.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
Cardiff Giant?
What's up, man.
Yes?
Ugh...
I'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, I'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Yes.
Where's Spa.
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
'Strapped?'
It means you got a gun?
Why? What I say bad?
See you later.
Nah, see, Maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. He, you know, he tied in with the club. Set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
No shit?
A little Charlie, perhaps.
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Come, now. You just got here.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Sure. You boys want anything?
We're square.
Can I borrow a piece of --
Yes. You're going to New York.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
Keys.
What about my keys?
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
But, Max --
We're square.
Yes, sir.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
The Red Dragon.
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Edinburgh.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Yes, sir.
What?
How's it feel?
Solid, daddy.
Ain't nuthin' in the world to give you that real deep cool. Like girl. You there?
Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
I don't want your money.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
Okay, okay.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
What for?
Did you ever study anything wasn't part of some con?
I can't make out that shit.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Where am I gonna start?
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Now about our coming up in the world a little. You're not naive. You're a man of the world. The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You know folks. They want their leaders to be prosperous. One hand washes the other.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Is the program ready?
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
I know.
Yes. Did you eat?
Hush your mouth.
What do you think?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
We need you too!
Get some sleep.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
Dear heart, where are you?
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Entirely.
If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work teaches us humility.
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
I better not come in.
I mean it's late, baby.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
How many you turning out?
500.
What does Sidney say?
Well, all right, then.
Fine as May wine.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
So what about him?
You want to be the head man?
That's right.
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
[I'm on to Juarez.]
So what do I get in return?
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
Deal.
[What's the PIN number?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Don't lie to me.]
[What money?]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
Who's he?
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[I want you.]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Don't lie to me!]
What is it?
I drink.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Nothing wrong.
So how's business?
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
What are you doing here?
You mean a misfire?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Where are you from, Creasy?
Potential? I don't understand.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Hmmm?
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
What are you doing?
Do you think he'll come back?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
Did you sleep alright?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
I know you're not.
Could I ask you a question?
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
Creasy... Wait.
Last night. Do you know something?
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman, does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
[No. Why?]
Good news. You're going back to school.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Our child's safety is at stake.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
He has to go, Samuel.
What? Who?
Creasy.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
[Is that good or bad?]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
I could see she likes you.
Yeah, sure.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
It must be one o'clock.
All right, I'll see you!
Who you gonna call?
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
We just talked.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Hey! What are you doing here?
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
I feel fine.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
Yes, I know.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
No...
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
I'm stag.
Are you kidding?
No, I'm not kidding.
What time is it?
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
What, Ma?
I said, is she Italian girl?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
You want a beer, Ang'?
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Ma, you want something to eat, some tuna fish?
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
Well...
On accounta...
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
Tommy...
Wadda you so sore about?
Waddaya talking about?!!
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
That's right.
Miss you, Walt.
Look at that right eye.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
You really think we hurt him that bad?
This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
Wisconsin.
What?
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Jesus to Jesus and eight hands around! Duke, did I ever tell you how I beat Dartmouth by intercepting a pass?
Never heard of him.
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
People will talk.
Give us this day our daily...
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
I was just asking...
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
C-A-M-E-M...?
What are they peeking at? Captain Waldowski in the shower?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Black capsule.
Or you can let him knock himself out. You personally'd be sending him to his grave.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
All of them?
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
Our minds?
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
You're an attractive man.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Very happily married.
Ayuh.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
You don't go after the local scrunch?
Why can't you look at him?
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
Now I know that's been my problem since I was a kid. But it only caught up to me last night.
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
The blonde dish.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
O'Reilly!
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Good morning, Colonel.
Damn.
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
How is he?
You're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, Ann.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Say, he's a friend of mine.
Uh-huh . . .
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Me?
Do you care if I sit down out here?
About me?
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh!
All set, Ann?
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
The Websters.
What?
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
The letter from John Doe.
There is no letter.
John Doe.
What John Doe?
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Looks all right
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Hurry up, Pop.
All right, boys, here he is.
I got it all ready. Here.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Now listen, Annhe can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
Have you seen him?
He's watching the other door.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Had any schooling?
Where'd you play?
Did you find her?
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
What?
Sure. Mostly often.
Ba-ll!
It must be some kind of a gag.
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Join the John Doe Club.
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myselfI get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jeffersonand Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Well?
How about family? Got any family?
No.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
Is there anything wrong?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Oh!
Uh-huh.
Nineteen!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Is there a crowd in the street?
They're not usually graduate students.
You're my hero.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
Where did you find an old recording like that?
Used record shop down on Turk Street. I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson.  Memories... Memory Lane or something...
You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
What's the suspect's name?
What do you got on Korda?
Is that all?
For now that's all.
Open your shirt.
Yeah.
Same here. I've watched you in action. Very impressive.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You don't like New York?
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
Is there something wrong with that?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
We see each other every couple of months.
No. Actually I think it's fucking crazy, I don't know if I could do it.
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
I think I can handle that one.
You think you can learn, McCall?
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
What's the first commandment?
Yes.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
You know why I like the track?
See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.  What do you think?
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
We lost.
How long you been coming here?
Is it always like this?
He's cutting down the visibility.
He's got the girl.
How many have you lost?
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
That's a chance I gotta take.
McCall, you all right?
Only that floor.
I worship you.
I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
What do you want from me?
You got a bet on the game tonight?
What do you think?
Yeah that's it.
What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
Scottie?
Scott...
...the hell are you talking about?
Prude.
...at the top of the stretch it's Cozy Girl in front with Backtrack coming on... Cozy Girl by a length, Backtrack closing...
Tell him to give me a raise.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
What do you need?
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
Why?
Who are you?!
The guests are here.
It's time to wake up.
Halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  So he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
Divinity?
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
Until you're on the net where the corporation can't touch you, you can't open the system.  They'll eject it if you do.
Where the hell are you going?
But what if he doesn't --
We're going to have to reconfigure.
How long?
What about the customers with reservations?
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
He had access to the keys --
You're jumping to conclusions.
Try harder.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
An interface attendant.
Need the disk back!
Cleaning up a mess.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
But you were with me.
Sorry?!
Don't know what you're talking about.
There?
Voice activate.
Standard, modern, upscale --
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
So how can we get to it?
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
Yeah, right.
I can hardly walk...
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
What's a Triac?
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension.
... Nothing.
NEW POWER COINS!!
Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.
The earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over?
Look closer.
And how do we release the power?
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
GET OFF ME!
Simon says...
"Basically".
That was a CHEAP shot!
How the heck?!...
We're asking you to go to prison.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
The goddamned bastards.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
Are you frightened?
So what happened?
I came into this world flat on my ass.
No. Not everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
When my money moves, I go with it.
We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Who hired the bastard?
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
You ain't even a man yet.
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
I can just imagine.
You here with Bobby?
What's the matter?
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
Luciano.
I was calling yesterday.
Something came up.
I needed to see you again.
Same here.
It's a mask.
I booked passage to London.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
You fellas got names?
Meyer just finished the books.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
You're getting' 10 cc's
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
Meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
I'm glad ya come.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
They're friends of our enemy.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
The kid just called me stupid.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
I must know more of you, my son.
Then perhaps you need to know me.
I've got friends.
I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
He's an animal!
What about the share.
I got partners.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
If you give him the chance, Lansky will betray you like Judas.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
We were overdue to get hit.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
And what do you want out of this?
Wanna know what I think?
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
Anything!
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
What?
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
At the moment, yes.
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
What's the matter?
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Holy shit.
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
Tell me what?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Stu?
What's the matter?
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
The ring...
Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Is there something else I can do for you?
So, what do you think?
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
Uh-huh?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
And where is she?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Moscow.
I see.  How much?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular people.
I did not--
Never.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
But it *isn't*?
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Huh?
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
Yeah. What about the second act?
Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Yeah.
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
My friends?
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
Shut up, Diz.
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Any time.
I'll cherish ya.
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Is the wind tired out there?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
We're gonna get married.
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
Okay--I mean--
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Huh?
You know, we're getting married.
The war's on!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Sam Foley--dead!
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Henry Hill.
I *won't* send Horace Miller!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Me! Jim--how--?
Y-yes, Jim.
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Jeff for Senator.
A dirty frame!
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Will the Senator yield?
I yield.
Well, it isn't much, but if you insist, here's this week's. 
Thank you, sir.
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
It does!
Mr. President! A point of order!
Yes, sir, I yield for a question.
Now, Amos, now--  What?
Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
Can't you?
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
What is it?
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll *see* that you get there.
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
No. What had you better--?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Right.
I see. *This* one is so simple--
Oh, just a day--
Committee, huh?
The Steering Committee.
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
*This* is.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Go right ahead.
I also answer to whistles.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
What do they--? Who are all those--?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Do you want to dictate them?
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Hurray!
Ah! That's more like it! What?
A camp! Well!
Then you *did* say it.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
"So help me God."
Order, gentlemen!
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
Since the time of Adams--not Washington.
How's that, buddy?
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
One moment, friends, let's give the Senator a break.  Now, where'd you say you studied law?
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
Chick--
Let's get away from here. 
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Go away, Nosey.
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
No?
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
What do you want, Senator?
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Every word that boy said is the truth! I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit for any place of honor or trust in this land! Expel me--!
That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle than a prima-donna.
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
That's him. Let him in.
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
What do you think?
Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
Jim, you don't have to--
Just a minute, Joe!
You can't say *that* to--
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
Maybe he won't get up.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
I haven't.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Are these the articles?
Were you present when all these things took place?
Are they true!
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
What?
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Yes.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
I've often thought about going back.
You have?
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Ready?
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Mary, I'm going home.
The guy's balmy.
Huh?
You're a fool, Babe.
You're acting like a school girl.
Look, I can do it!
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
With pay!  She is out the door.
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"
I wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
Boy, was he burning.
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
I wish you luck, sir.
Come on, John. What happened?
Miss Bennett please!
Must we have the echo?
It's a lie!
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Huh?
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Have a drink?
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
I'm Chairman?
Now, where were we?
Why not?
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out.  Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
Yeah. What?
What do you think you're doing?
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Every man to his taste, sir.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
You're Walter, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Oh, I do too, sir.
You came home last night - without them.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
But she's on the telephone
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
Why are they ganging up against me?
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
Uh-huh. What are they?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
Dr. Mumford.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.
But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd.
My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
We're interested in any new therapies. How would you characterize your approach?
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
I don't want to hear any more today.
Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come.
Why? I'm paying for this.
No?
What exactly is it supposed to do?
-- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
We've been talking about her, mostly.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
Tastes good.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
I'd better get in there.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?
And the Brocketts?
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Is she a friend of yours?
Finally, some common sense...
Why don't you tell me?
What can you tell me about this?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Even if you don't think it's real?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
We don't discuss it.
No.
Sorry... I'm done.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
And this is legitimate therapy?
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
Yeah?
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
Transference.
Mother...
But...
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Anything... just ask.
Will you wait for me?
In maybe three or four issues.
Weekly or monthly?
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
Do you think that's what he wants?
What'd he say?
...What balls on this guy? What're we...  ...going steady? Jesus.
You're Doc Mumford.  Skip Skipperton.
..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
I gotta pee.  Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! Right?  Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
Is that the question?
This is great!
Don't you like this?
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
You don't think I'm insane?
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
Sounds like you have several.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
It wasn't the best situation.
You were messed up, man.
At least you pulled yourself out...
Things got a lot worse.
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
And a birth certificate is enough?
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Really?
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Yes... your particular approach.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
And what ritual would that be?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Immune from what?
The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds.
What just happened?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
You will not believe it.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue.
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass spittoon!
No women allowed.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
What are you doing here?
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
You swear?
Yes.
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
We're almost there.
That "thing" gets me excited.
The things that get you excited.
There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
Why would I do that?
No... Why?... Should I?
Is he supposed to look like that?
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
Oh yes I do! I have something right here!
I was mistaken.
You lied to me!
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
Finish the inscription, idiot!
Hey,... don't I know you?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I know you did.
And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
And what's that?
So who killed him?
We didn't think this through very well.
When was that?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
But you're a superhero.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
He's dead.
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
Should I kill them?
They always call the great ones nuts.
And the light goes out...
Really?
I saw him walk you home.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Or talk?
Why?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
What have they got that we ain't got?
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
I just want to be a superhero.
At the Frankenstein Center.
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
My heart died a long time ago.
And it would be the right thing to do.
You sure that's how you spell it?
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
There's a vague similarity.
Or flowers.
Let's go.
Maybe there was traffic.
Roy --
So where's the art?
But... the silverware?
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
You did?
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Sorry.
To us!
Through there!
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
What do you think Napoleon will do?
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
Yes -- who spoke up?
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
You realize what is at stake?
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
Who is there?
General Bonaparte?
Come back in an hour.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Oh -- where do you come from?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
His paws are frozen and he cannot walk.
When you eat him, may I have some?
Why didn't you wake me then?
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
No, sir.
Would you like some brandy?
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
Lisette.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
No... nothing at all.
I know of no better time.
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Well, you shall see.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Were you in love with him?
And now?
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Of course.
Were you in love with any of them?
Yes.
Were any of them married?
Promise me.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Why not?
That's all I can say.
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
Well, whatever the hell you wanted to do, you are going to tell me everything right now.  Do you understand?!
I wrote it.
I couldn't face telling you.
God help me -- yes.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
Of course, my dear.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Oh, no, I am very happy.  But you must have patience with me... I know nothing at all of what a wife must know.  And I know nothing about men. My papa has never allowed me even to have a pet of the male gender.
Does she deserve anything better?
Those are extremely harsh terms.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
Naw, it ain't like that.
Yeah.
You paid cash?
Y'all never use it?
I don't know!
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
What you mean talk to her?
Naw, I already ate.
Me neither.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
This you?
What?
Why?
So.
How can they do this?
What's the matter?
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
What we gonna do?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
What you see?
I don't know.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
It's locked.
Can I help you?
Here I come!
I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll down.
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
Nigga, you got knock the fuck out.
You too.
Excuse me?
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
Are they still out there?
Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?
And some rolling papers.
Get 'em, Craig!
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
Where's Craig?
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Get on.
William.
You too big.
What?
Hey, how you get out of here.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
What about that ugly dog?
Need to lose some weight.
Damn, big bro.  You swung that like Sammy Sosa.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Elroy.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
Don't remind me.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
Where to, sir?
Amtrack?
Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
I appreciate that.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
You shot her?
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I would also like to apologize.
For what?
Good luck.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Come with us, sir.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Daddy?
I will do no such thing.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
What about the gun?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
Keep your voice down.
Again.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
On TV.
No way.
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Can we go now?
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?
Please...
What?
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Oh, Jesus ...
Hi.
Well?
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
Hey!
Goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
Gimme a dollar.
Why?
A surprise?
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
I been mindin' Pearl.
O, she's all right.
Leavin', boy?
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
No.
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
And the Lord told that man --
Yes! Yes!
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Who?
Is he hit pretty bad?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
John don't like him much.
Pearl dotes on him.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
What?
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Hing, hang, hung.
John...
Now can I tell?
John! Don't!
Why?
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Where are we goin', John?
I'm hungry, John.
Are we goin' home, John?
I'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  You-all have your work cut out!
I mind you said there was two.
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
I'll see to Pearl.
Huh?
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Tell me what, boy?
Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
What are you doing, boy?
Your mother says you tattled on me, boy. She says you told her that I asked you where that money was hid.
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
How old are you?
Sure, that's no secret.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
O no! Your turn!
Can I have milk too?
No.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
What's their names?
Pearl and John.
Yes; from the first night.
The first night?
Our honeymoon.
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
Answer me!
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
My flesh and blood!
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
Where's she at?
She took them kids with her?
Gracious, gracious! You are a good woman, Miz Cooper!
How you figgerin' to raise them two without a woman?
What are you after them for?
Pearl and John!
You'll whip me!
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
This gentleman warn't like them! He just give me a sody and the book.
Now who was this?
He never asked me for nothin'.
What'd you all talk about?
They're just simple tests, Nan. We'll both be right here.
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
How can you tell?
You okay?
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
Yeah.
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
Who?
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Meanwhile...?
How you doing, pal?
She dreamed this would happen...
Decide to take a day off after all?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Dad -- what you doing here?
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Sure, but...
What's the Coroner got to say?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
Get into bed.
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
I must be going nuts...
You okay?
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
And then what happened?
Maybe we should call Rod, have him come over too. He might get jealous.
You feel better now, right?
No more fights.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
About what?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
An evening gown.
What do you wear in the morning?
What is it, Anna?
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Misha! Misha!
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
She's right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
What time have you, Gaston?
I am, Gaston.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Only one in the rear, I'm afraid.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Yes, Leon...
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
Comrade Buljanoff...
How much does this cost?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
That's even better.
Yes, monsieur.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
What's new?
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
We'll leave these papers here for your further consideration. Au revoir, madame.
What can I do about it?
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Private.
Confess what?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
You're going to force us... huh?
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Yes. Could you give me some information?
What?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
No.
Love to.
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
So that is your house?
He takes good care of that.
Is that customary?
And what do you do for mankind?
Thank you. Thank you.
That is correct.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
Was that talkative?
Thank you.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
Room service speaking.
I don't like your following me.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Must one always be after something?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Will you smile?
Just smile.
Then you should go back to your table.
I have never heard one.
Yes.
I don't look too foolish?
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
You see I couldn't shout that.
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
I promise... I swear.
I don't think so.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
You must, darling.
I must talk to my brothers!
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Much happier.
What shall we get? The news!
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Did you win?
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Now, Swana...
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Did I hear something about jewels?
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
You can't imagine.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Yes, Swana.
Am I interrupting?
Months, Swana.
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Good morning.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
I told you to go, madame.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Go on.
Here, please...
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Your Highness.
I am sorry... I have to leave.
We could check the tape again, sir.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
So ... let's go ...
We'll see about that ...
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
Son of a bitch.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
Yes ... I got the money.
To protect his people.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
McCord? ...
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
I like it.  I like the idea.
Where's Hunt now?
And?
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
Why not?
We can't touch Hoover --
I would personally enjoy doing that, sir.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
Who?
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
That fruitcake!  What about him?
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
I did?
Silence!
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him. That's why I appointed him.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
Sir?
Dick, you don't have to make a statement.  Herb covered it for you.
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
Mr. President!
She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old college kid ...
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
I believe you're right, boss.
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Mr. Castro.
Yes.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
My father built the house where I was born with his own hands.  Oh, it wasn't a big house ...
How about you?  Are you going to win?
We took his system out.
Well, you have CIA people all over the place.  Helms has seen to that.  Then there's Kissinger's staff. Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe the leaker.
I always get my man.
Who we working for?
Mein Kampf?
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
No, Henry.  I don't.
Who are you talking to like this, you insignificant shit ...
You'll pick up the middle on this one - the Jews and Negros.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Yes, Mr. President.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
He was a politician.
Did you cry when he died?
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
Uh, wait ...
Jesus Christ!
This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never buy it.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
But it was all we had.
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
Ernie Davis.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
Sir?
Yes, yes.
No, sir ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Amen to that.
I want a divorce.
It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I...
I'll do it.  No more.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
Buddy? ...
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Do you really want this, Dick?
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
Hiding what?
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
Lost.
Whatcha mean by that?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
But -- how'd you know it was mine?
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
Didn't know there was any.
Want a cup?
'Predate it.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Yes, you've circled round.
You don't know what he thinks.
Most don't.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
None of that explains your man though.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Well what would you call him.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
It could be.
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
...You ride Winston.
Llewelyn Moss?
...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?
We goin' in?
Probably must be.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em?
No sir.
You gonna drive out there?
How's that, Sheriff?
Natural to the line of work they was in.
Yes Sheriff.
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
...Be careful.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Llewelyn.
Goin' out.
Goin' where?
You should be used to that.
What did you tell him?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
Why would I let you do that?
I know where the money is.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
I know something better.
What's that.
And where is that.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
Is Llewelyn there?
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
How much?
...Will there be somethin' else?
With what?
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
Sir?
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
I could come back then.
Just call it.
Everything.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
November the 28th, last year.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
Okay.
That's not an answer.
Okay. We can stop that.
Could I get another room.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor.  His name is Chigurh.
I know how he found me.
It's called a transponder.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
The heroin. You don't have it.
I don't know.
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
...plenty
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
No, Elden, I need to...
Bad idea...
Junior year!
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
You're lying!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
I know that...
That's a nice name for what you need...
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
Need something else?
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
They're fine... you miss it?
Who are these idiots?
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
That's my son! My son is dead!
I'm sorry.
...what're you saying?
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Did you watch it yet?
Oh, Betty --
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
What?
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
No, Del.
Why do they keep calling you George?
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Didn't I?
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Why are you doing this to me?
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
Oh. Of course... sorry.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Thanks...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
I got you, Del...
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
I don't know.
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Yes.
You're in serious danger!
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
Where you headed, Betty?
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
Like Rome?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
God, that's awful!
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Who?
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
Are you sure I can borrow this?
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
Huh?
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
Like what?
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Relax, we brought the cash.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
Now, that's really stupid.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
He told us it's in the Buick.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
It's not here. Let's go.
We can live with that.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
I hope you're right...
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
So what the fuck's a Finn?
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
I know that.
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
No.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
I never said that I believed...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
...and how long did she work here?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Really?
We know that...
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Hmm?
Is there a problem, George?
Yeah? The sport utility?
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
Aren't they precious?  Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Yeah?
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Waitaminute -
'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell.
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
...Pete?
Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em.
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.
Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up!
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
What sat mean exactly, Everett?
Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
It's just a symbol, honey -
...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Well, we need that ring.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car?
You didn't know that at the time!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
The preacher said it absolved us.
Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be...
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
But...
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
I am. Hur you?
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
Mama said you was hit by a train!
It's bona fide!
She's at the five and dime.
You, Zack?
Yes, Sir.
I been calling for four months.
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Come back here, kid!
What for?
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Why?
Who gave you this idea?
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Who's that?
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Great ass.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
What's your name, boy?
I want your D.O.R.
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
Mayo, are those your friends?
Yes, sir!
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
See you in the fleet, sir!
I didn't call you anything before that.
No.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir!
No, sir.
What did you call me, Mayo?
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Yes I do!
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Is your brother a flyer?
He was. He died.
Vietnam?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
How late?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
You what?
Sid, there's no baby.
No. I never feel like that.
What did you tell him about the baby?
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Really?
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Not me.
Do you go to school?
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I vote for the motel.
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
You stayed after all.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
That was great.
God.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Are those for me?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'd like to come with you.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
He said he grew up poor?
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
Jets.
You told us it would grow out an inch.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
Thanks for covering for me.
No problem.
There is not one thing funny here.
Stop it!  Stop it!
What?  What do you want me to do?
Okay, okay!  Okay.
You got an idea?
Are you okay?
-- posed to mean?
The walls are steel, right?
NOT THAT ONE?!
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Keep your voice down.
This was your department, Junior.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Where did you get this clown?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Cell phone.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
You don't look so good.
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
Huh?
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
Third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  Mr. Pearlstine used it as an office.
Master bath.
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
That's highly inappropriate.
Push that button for me, will you?
No fucking way.
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
Makes me nervous.
Why?
No, Edgar Allen.
Too many stairs.
Got us in here, didn't I?
The crowd goes wild.
What's going on?!
What?!
Damn it!
Wait.
Feel okay?
Shaky?
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 
Oh, please.
What am I, a five year old?
What, what, what is it?!
Got him!
We're never getting out of here.
He'll do something.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
I'm sorry.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
What if I keep dropping?
What if I spazz out?
Where is the Glucogen?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Tyrone...
No...
Okay now, er, Huey, so what's your telephone number?
What are you doing with the gun?
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
I expect to hear from you soon. If Huey Newton takes a crap, I want to know how big it was. Otherwise I'm gonna come looking for you. And I won't be as "friendly" as today.
What are you crazy?
Inspector Brimmer
Who's they?
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Shit, I ain't doing nothing. White bread asks for cocaine, I take his money. Shit... you know... It was just a hustle.
I don't know. Look around man.
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
Are you finished?
Rodgers... this is no good...
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Granted, the Free Huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left...
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Yeah.
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
What's the pig's name?
Brimmer.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Fuck is up?!
You alright?
Where is he?.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Yeah.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
When?
Late summer.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
That would be nice.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
You got me beat on both accounts.
I know him well enough?
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
How did this... how did I let this happen?
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
If you go, I'll care for them as if they were my own.
I know that.
Two pounds, fourteen ounces.
We did.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
Very well, let us move on to...
Sir?
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
Perhaps.
Civility is a secondary virtue.  It is superseded by duty.
Do you see that, Colonel?
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
What now, sir?
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp.  I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island.
These four wagons must be his.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days?
Where?
Don't go in there.
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
That's right.
That's not enough.  Tell me.
I don't care.  I hate him.
You don't hate him.
Captain Marion, I understood you to be a Patriot.
It's Mister Marion.
Thirteen years...
Balderdash!
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
I recognize him now.  Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age?
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
I am, I think.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
When?
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.
Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
Goodbye, Francis.
Your son, what did you name him?
Thank you.
How far away?
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Thank you.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Gray.
I was sorry to hear about your son.
That bad?
Not yet, Thomas.
Father... I killed those men...
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Is he really all right?
Yes.
But don't you dare say that.
I don't get it.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I'm sure you're not.
No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you.
Was it Pascow?
You need a glass?
God, that's fine.
What were you listening to?
Nice.
You folks ready to go on?
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
Not yet...how much further is it?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
What do you mean?
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
I'm not climbing that.
Is there quicksand?
I guess so...but...
Don't worry about that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
What did we do, Jud?
Rachel not feeling well?
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
It's Ellie's cat.
Shit! Look at this mess!
I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
Thank you. Thank you so much.
The movers--
She's finally asleep.
Well, honey...you know that...
I heard you tonight.
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
That's forgotten.
You better get going, hon.
Louis, are you sure?
That boat is my livelihood!
How does he do that?
She.  Goes.  Free.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
Elizabeth goes free!
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
No!  You gave your word!
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right?
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
If I had known --
Me!
Come on!
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
Say again?
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
I'll be at the wheel myself.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Move!
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
I'd die for her.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
Shut up, before you lose them all!
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
Yes.
What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith'?
I think he's telling the truth.
He's not telling the truth.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
What happened here?
A moment.
Speak.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
No, thank you.
This is our world, Susan, and once you realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end is on the throne of heaven.  Science is the quest for divine perfection.
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Icky!  What's happening?
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
Considering what?
Poppy, please --
Did you feel that?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
Well, at this time, I mean that is to say, it is difficult to project --
Where did he go?
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
Is that what Argon told you?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Like Crazy Glue?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Really?  What have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
I guess I should be flattered.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
You're insane.
Susie!  You gotta help me!
They did it to me!
We don't?
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
That was an egg?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Victim my ass!  You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage!  Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Just like old times.
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
What's wrong?
I could go with you.
No cheese.
You made this out of my hair?
Did you go?
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Susie... I...
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
Yes.
We were different people then.
Things do change.
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
That's impossible.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
And you have him?
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
Exactly.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
May I use your telephone?
That's considerate of you.
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
Your place?
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
I know that.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
Anne, come here. Listen
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Are you crazy?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
That's ridiculous.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
That's an excellent idea.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Fine. Have a seat.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Oh, is that so?
How's that?
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
With me you can always do business.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Right - for the first time this year.
It has been alleged - yes
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
Not on my own beat, no.
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Mr. Schuyler .
Is that so?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Araby?
No?
How do you like your bath, sir?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
You're my what?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Yes.
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
I bet.
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it
There you go, talking like a woman!
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Nothing.
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
Hello, Stew.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
What other girl?
No.
I have it here.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Traps shut!
Hello, Smith.
Holy jumping swordfish!
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Okay - you remember Joe
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
With pleasure, Madame!
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
All right, Grandma
Good morning, everybody  Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh?  Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
Have you seen this? 
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
It's haunted just the same.
I just putter.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
Mary Sue?
No. I want to know.
... Sex.
Yes ...  It's just that ...
I won't.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
Having kind of a tough time.
Bud brought it to me.
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
But I really should get home.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
Oh, George ...
All night?
Sure you are.
It goes away ... It'll go away.
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
... Lover's Lane.
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
Want some bridge mix?
"Changes."
No. What?
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
Are you alright?  What is it?
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
Dan! Arrest them!
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
God, David. Just give it to me!
Get lost!
What did you do?
I don't believe this.
Just take deep breaths.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Who's that?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
JENNIFER!
I could like kill a guy with these things.
Jen please ...
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
You have no right to do this.
Me too. Sounds swell.
It's okay.
What's wrong?
You're reading?
Are you sure?
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
You got the admissions letter.
Right here.
Oh. Thanks, Margaret.
So what's it like?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here.  Mmm. So sweet.
Real rain?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Because we don't belong!
Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
... Hi.
So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again.
I can't.
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
Look ...
I didn't do anything wrong.
OW!
How long do you think you've been here?
Bud?
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
I'm so glad you're here.
What?
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
Just listen to me ...
Forget about that!
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Well don't you?
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Really?
Oh, hi.
What's wrong?
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.
Yeah ...
Oh GOD ...
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
And what was this?
Hello.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
...please, I just don't want it....
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
Yeah I can't.
Are you gonna do it?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
Goodbye.
I just want to know where she's staying.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Hello, this is Back.
I'm just laying on my bed.
Where are you?
I'm in my bedroom.
No.
Do you like porno movies?
Are your pants off?
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
No.
Hello?
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Uh-huh.
Me?
I know but I....how much is it?
No. I'm sorry.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
I know I did. But I don't.
This is not cool.
It was cool last night.
Are you telling me no?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
It's fine. It was fun, though.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Oh My God.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
Sure.
Do you want to pick me up?
Sure.
Alright?
....Hi.....
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?
No, no. I did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You see?
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
....yeah....
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
What did he want?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Are you learning how to play it?
Yes? I'm trying.
Yeah.
If you come to Hawaii --
What do you mean?
Hello?
Lena?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
Are you ok?
I'm fine are you ok?
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
For what?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
Well who did?
I cut myself.
On my knife.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Hello, how are you?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. #4. 91403.
And your name?
-- and this is confidential?
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
No one will know your name.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
That's that.
How you doin' Barry?
Yeah.
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
You're goin' on a trip?
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
....now: this pudding?
Hey.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Seven o'clock.
I know.
Seriously.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
That's cool.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
So they'll go.
What did you say?
It's ok. That's alright.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
You ready?
Are you ready?
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'm sorry. You're right.
Should I call you later?
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
Once or twice.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
Mustn't do that, sir.
I must grant him his last rites.
It's not even noon --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
What the devil --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
That's enough.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
An innocent child is dead.
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Who's to say I did not?
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
I'm here.
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
And he's never once attempted escape?
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
Well...?
Do you favor its publication?
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
Shut down?
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
Of course.
How is the patient faring?
As for the author... shoot him.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
Don't start --
There's something else I want from you.
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
It's a long story, this one.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
What have they done to you now?
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
Go on, child.
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
What thought is that?
Oh, but I am!
-- words alone are insufficient.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Good God, Marquise --
This is neither the time nor the place --
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
I'd rather read, thank-you.
No, when I was but a tender lad--
Not you too
I wonder sometimes.
You're just scared.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
My name is Orson Welles
The actor
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
You know that can't happen.
Oh, why is that?
There's no call for that language-
There. That's right.
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
You needn't use that language with me
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Sir? 
Why did we not know about this sooner?
Huh?
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
You drink at 10 am, do you?
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
Telling stories.
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
Right-
But with compassion and insight--
Okay, boy wonder, what?
I don't have it anymore?!
He'll destroy us.
So, who is he? We have to know him.
Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
I don't give a shit about-
Hey, kid. Gregg.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
Hedy Lamarr?
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.
Is that from one of the Gospels?
You gonna watch?
What have I done?
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Get out
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
For the title
This is an abomination There's no music and--
They've all seen a rough cut
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
And this is the evening edition. Notice anything?
Well it' s all you've got !
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?!
I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
Oh God. . .
How 'bout a real drink?
He's Christ?
They wanna talk to you.
Aside from everything else, your family all right?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
What?
This looks done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Hit me in the face.
And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
You wasn't with her, were you?
You know, like bang her or anything?
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
You want us to wait for you?
Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
Screw you, Jack.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
What?
But you said "you."
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
What time is it?
Yeah. At night.
Three more, I figure.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
It feels real good.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
Jake...
Take off my pants.
You're not interested in him?
What did I say?
All I did...
Where you been all day?
What'd you see?
What was it about?
Jake, no --
You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
Jake --
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
Sure, what else is new?
Open the door, Vickie.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
Never felt better.
Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
No, you're his wife.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
This is Doyle's house.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
For instance?
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
She never left the apartment --
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
-- until yesterday morning.
What time?
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Who said they left then?
Who left -- where?
If possible -- both.
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
You think he's getting out of here?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
Your Lisa?
I told you that --
Like an old hambone?
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
For getting rid of that cast.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Wrong day?
That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Read some good books.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Something wrong?
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
I don't know what you mean.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
I'm not ready for marriage.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
You're never going to marry?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
What about this morning? Any developments?
Police?
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
What?
What are you two talking about?
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
Hello.
Mrs. Doyle?
You haven't even heard from him?
Who's Thorwald?
Not too active.
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
You mean leave the magazine?
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Lisa, please!
There's nothing to see.
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
Yeah.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
Thinking about Thorwald?
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
What doesn't?
Inside stuff?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
I have the whole weekend off.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
From his landlord -- once a month.
But you're not?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
L. B. Jefferies.
Phone number?
A new disease.
I'm glad they let you out.
Feel okay?
What?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Meaning me?
What?
You satisfied or you want more?
Where can we meet?
Buzz Gundersen.
Hi.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
You still want to go home, Moose?
You can't protect me.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
You thought I was Mom?
That's funny!
Shoot, Jimbo.
What would you do, Dad?
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Except yourself!
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
I was talking to Jim.
He's home.  I heard the car.
Can you tell me why you killed the puppies, Plato?
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
He has a knife.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
Who knows.  Plato?
I hitched.
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Yeah?
Nobody talks to children!  They just tell them one thing and mean another.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
Let's see how long we can stay under.
Man, you're schizoid!
I don't want you for my father!
Plato?
I'm here.
Why?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
My gun?
I need it.
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
Why?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
'Bye, Mom.
How!
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
No!  You're not tearing me loose any more.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
No.
I don't know why--!
Pretty mixed up?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Okay--
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
"Life is crushing in on me."
See, I'm new.
Yeah--why--
The kids take me.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
Goodbye!  See you!
You cold?
Neither can I.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
No.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
Sure.  Lots of times.
I felt like it.
Where you going?
You don't need to do that.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
So do you.
I never felt so clean before.
Is he your friend?
Don't give it a thought.  Only three million dollars a month!
Hi, Plato!
Judy--we're ready for you now.
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Do you think your father means that?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
How did you know that?
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Didn't you forget something?
I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
Gabriel, you promised!
To all those cons...
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
I've been doing good, though.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Radio said negative five.
Negative five?
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Saw me --
What.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Tell me again.
Well, I don't know about that --
You sold him out.
Get the hell off of me!
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
No, Nick, no --
...maybe I die for Nick...
Gabriel!
Jack. Jack Bangs.
No!
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Get your own room, Ashley.
Nick...
What?
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
I saved your life.
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
No --
Who are you now.
You're not Nick Mason...
So you could get with my sister.
She says a lot of things.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What'd they call her in high school?
A station wagon in Canada.
What's her greatest fear?
Her brother.
The hell you don't.
Five million?
I said, who the hell made the map?
So what the hell good are you...
They won't recognize me.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
NO.
No gun.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Get in the CAR!
Ash?
Where the HELL did he go?
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
Five years. Since it opened.
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
What the hell was that about --
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Merlin, I didn't know --
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Monsters in the gelatin...
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Hell you haven't.
Three days, man.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
She's using a new perfume.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
Thought you hate your old man.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
Don't move, Rudy!
Tell Ashley... I...
Do what?
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!
POP! That was My card!
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
That's what it looks like!
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
You fuckin' wish.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
Seymour Scagnetti.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
We can work this out, can't we?
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
Pam Grier.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
Who, Mr. White?
A little.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
It's a scene. Memorize it.
But what is this?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
Myself and Mr. Pink?
I'm sorry.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Sure.
How is he?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
Give me my book.
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
What for?
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
Mr. Pink.
I told 'em not to touch the alarm. They touched it. I blew 'em full of holes. If they hadn't done what I told 'em not it, they'd still be alive.
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
What happened?
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one job basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
You really think we were set up?
That's not correct.
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
What do you think?
Nope.
How can you be so sure?
I got the diamonds.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
We can't take him to a hospital.
Without medical attention, this man won't live through the night. That bullet in his belly is my fault. Now while that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a helluva lot to me. And I'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
If we don't, he'll die.
You wanna shoot me, you little piece of shit? Take a shot!
We don't think this place is safe.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
You takin' his side?
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Who shot who?
Look of things, she doesn't.
Tell them to come on in.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
What's the matter with her?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
There's a nice boy.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
He's learning his letters.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Tell me, darling.
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
It's going to Sonora.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Drop yours. I'm gunshy.
I -- lost something.
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
In a fight?
Where'd they go?
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Yeah, it does.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
What did you come back for?
How's that?
You'll live.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
Yeah, how did you know?
I said I didn't care.
But I want to stay.
What's the matter -- restless?
Even women?
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
He certainly could. About a month.
What's the use.
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?
We got to get movin'.
I said let's go.
Put on another one.
You're so nice.
What comes after Z?
That's the end of the line.
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
And you've got me all figured out?
But you're his brother.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Hey, Brenda.
Do I know you?
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Ray, run faster.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
It looks like the furnace.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
Then what are we going to do?
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
But he'll kill her!
It's the sequel.
The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
Stop touching his brain!
Stop! --
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Both of them?
Noooo!!!
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
What are we gonna do?
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Professor, what's the history of this house?
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
It's some kind of energy field. We better record this.
No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
I don't like this, this...
Saw who?!
I also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
Professor, I think you should see this.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
What are you working on?
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
You never could feel your legs.
It's okay. I understand.
How is she?
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Yo son, check this out.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?
It says, "Ray."
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
Hi!
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
MURDERED?!!
Carl's a jerk!
No comment!
Sorry, ma'am.
You see the sign! It's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time I'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
I'm so happy I could shit.
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
Get in, Mom! I have to open.
That's right.
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
She's gonna kill Scotty!
Goodnight, honey.
Shhhh..
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
I'm sorry, honey. But the birds will still be there next week.
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
"P" as in...
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
MOTHERFUCKER!!
It's not fair!!
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
So you do drink?
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
I do, please.
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
You got your wish.
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Certainly not!
Are we leaving?
What's he know?
What is it, Betty?
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Look. Don't say a word. I've taken an interest in you and I'm willin' to put up my time to help you. Besides, I think I know where to find your sister.
Where?
Can we go there now?
Which room is it?
Yes.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
May I have some water? I'm thirsty.
Drink.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
I'll give you a check.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What were you talking about?
And that was all?
She showed me a drawing.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
I'd like that.
Who the devil is he?
I'm going to find your sister.
Mary, when you first came here, I told you to look into your heart. You didn't listen to me. You listened to the policeman instead. You didn't find your sister, did you?
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
Do you think he knows about this?
What's that?
I'm tired of being afraid - of waiting.
I don't know.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
You'll be all right?
Such a simple matter. This figure is the symbol of the Palladists.
I can imagine.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
My window - - through which I see the world.
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
And you believe that?
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
Ah, my Jason -- always laughing -- always trying to help others.  He's a good boy, Miss -- he just talks that way.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
I'd forgotten.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Is it about Jacqueline?
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it  your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I'm afraid not.
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
That makes it all the more difficult 
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
I have taken care of Mary. I've spoken to her. She's going back to school.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Do you have other things?
No. Why?
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Oh, uh-huh.
...free-lance. You know.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
What's the first?
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
So what about kids?
Do you want them?
Why is that?
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
Do you want me to?
What?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
What kind of personal project?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
Can we look at one?
What about sex?
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
How did you know?
Why didn't you tell me?
Do you think that's such a good idea?
It won't. Are you ready?
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want.  I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
No.
You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
That's correct.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
You're really never going to make love again?
I can't.
Who? Elizabeth?
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
I don't know.
Because.
I can't tell you like this.
Why are you ashamed?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
I want to touch you.
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
Yes. I just got busy.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
But I'm not.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Goddammit, goddammit!! That son of a bitch!!  Well, at least I know you didn't fuck him.
Goddam right.
No, I didn't.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Yeah, I know.
God, no.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
Ann, in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas.  Did it occur to you that Graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
I guess.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Why, so you can go after him?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
Do you have to say that?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
Well, I wonder why.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
And what?
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Will you stop? Jesus.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Because I never got around to it.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Then why'd you call me?
What!?
No, but I did.
Here it is.
It looks like a tablecloth.
I get real busy between two and four.
Well, why would she want a sun dress? She's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins.
Do I know you?
The extrovert.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
She still is.
Nope.
Not exactly.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Talking.
Yes.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
When I was fourteen.
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Hello.
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
No.
You're intrigued?
Hello.
I want to see you.
Right now.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
You told Ann about this?
It won't. I trust him.
What do you mean?
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
I know. Will you please leave now?
John, we have nothing to talk about.
No.  You said three-fifty?
Will you lease month-to-month?
Really. How'd it go?
What tapes?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
No.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny.
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
How did he sound this time? Was he nervous? Depressed?
Medical clinic?
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Anything wrong?
No. I don't think so.
OK. But late.
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Can I call you at the office?
What do you want to call me at the office for?
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
So who changes?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
Yes?
That you, Rog?
It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
OK. It's apartment 1009, South Tower, Starliner Towers. May as well go there directly.
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
What?
You got it!
You got it!
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
In my time they used to call me the Merlin of Berlin.
Out of self comes selflessness.
In a way...
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
A free thinker.
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Indulge?
That's us.

He was adopted you know.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Brad!  Oh, Brad.
Poor Brad.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I NEED SOME
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
BRAD!
F for...
WHAT A JOKE...
Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host on the F. F. show.
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The fuck was that?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
How's the trip?
And?
What are you pouring tonight?
Highliner.
Glass or bottle?
You got it.
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
Are you a writer too?
No, I'm an actor.
Just tell me.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Um... seventy... something.
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county.  Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
You know that chick?
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
So what's the plan today?
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
What?
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Aye-aye, captain.
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Shut up. Shut your face.
Later.
Oh, boy.
You should call her.
Hey, there you are.
Where is Stephanie?
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Besides what?
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Obsessively.
Shut up.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
With Maya.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
You have to tell me --
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Let me use your phone.
What's up?
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Well?
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
Huh. Let me think.
Fucking chick's married.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
We gotta go back.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
No way. No way.
She tell you she was married?
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Hrnrnrn?
No, I'm okay.
Come on, let me drive.
You said it looked like a car accident.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Whatever. Sorry.
Well. That about does it.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Nice. Very nice.
Hey.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
"The Day After Yesterday."
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Yeah. Thanks.
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Sure.
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Yeah? Like what?
Okay. See you around.
I had class.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
Okay.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Hello?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
You quit drinking?
About four weeks.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
French or American?
So what do you think?
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
You talked to Wendy?
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
Only for pee or poop.
No.
There's dust in it.
Daddy.
I think it's contaminated.
My ballet recital.
I don't want you to die.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
I'm here.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
How can you say that?
Yes.
What's furry, furry rabbit?
What time is it?
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Where are you going?
It's getting stronger.
How many died?
No.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
Morgan?
The footprints.
What about them?
It's not broken.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
I don't think so.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
No money, eh?
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
Emmett.
I didn't know you were out.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
More than enough.
The Parkers seem like nice folks.
They've been kind to me.
I just came out to say goodbye.
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
Weren't you going to come out to say good-bye?
Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Where's Turley?
What's Turley like?
They got a saloon there?
I expect.
Doesn't look quite fair.
I understand.
It's not going to be easy.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
What about the law?
Why?
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
We didn't get that far.
That's the longest I ever did it. 'Bout bust a gut.
This a friend of yours?
He is now.
New record.
What are you talking about?
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
We'd rather stay.
He was murdered.
Rae, all we got is each other.
Get out. We have nothing to talk about.
Why come to me?
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
This is it, gents. My ma told me to head south past that rock.
Because they enjoy it.
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
Luck, I guess.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
Why'd you go into business with him?
Who's the owner?
Where's the dog now?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
How about you?
I don't want you to get hurt.
I wouldn't worry about that.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
I can't wait to meet her.
Why not?
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Hair and make-up?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Viktor, you should have said something.
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
I do?
Is Simone back to earth yet?
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Where are you?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
So you did meet her?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Of course.
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Who are you really?
No, I'm okay.
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
It was more in passing.
How will you do our love scenes?
Hal, what are you doing?
You can't.
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
-- Please, get away from me.
I was misquoted.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
Why?
How?
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
Okay, Dad.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
I know.  Thank her for me.
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
This is the story.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
Abduction?
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
What do you want -- ?
You're in breach.
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Thank you.  It's not important.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Hi.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Let's take it down a notch.
A star is...
You mean they buy it?
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
The only real truth is in the work.
You know what I'm talking about.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
--My God.
Are you calling me?
Why, Malcolm?
Why did you leave me?
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
What were they hiding from?
You use needles?
I'm going to see you again, right?
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
How do you draw now?
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
Where should I look then, Cole?
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
Words.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
No.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
Yes?
When?
Something happened, didn't it?
Yes, it did.
No, we're not.
Just help.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?
I wish I were somewhere else.
Don't go home, okay?
And you know what else?
What?
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Communicate?
Someone got hurt.
You can see her?
Cole, you're scaring me.
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
Yes, Cole?
How did you--?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssssstop it!
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
'Course, it's none of my business.
Alright!
What's a "little while?"
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
See?
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
I happen to be a professional.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Hey. Fuck you.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Are you crazy?
"Old Macdonald... had --"
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Down boy.
It's a farm, Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Chicken sandwich?
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
Let it go.
Getting ready.
Wait a minute --
No --
Listen to me --
Get out of here.
I almost thought for a second...
Second verse!
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
How are you going to find him?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Whatcha' doin'?
Oh, yeah?
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
What are you doing?!
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
It's my nature.
What's she see in that douchebag?
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Meat.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
Welcome home.
You're my princess, aren't you?
Who's that?
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
You.
Get your hands off my daughter!
I hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen Beaners up to West Virginia.
Kate McConnell.
But you could get killed, right?
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
So tell me about yourself.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Seriously?!?
Well?
Christ, what channel are we on?...
Yeah.
Mississippi's the other way!
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
Kate...
One to five?
Well, thanks for the lift.
He's just exhausted.
What are you thinking?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Order up!
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
No.
Six. Got it.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Hit the brakes!
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
We still on schedule?
Bandit I, do you copy?
You can't swear on these.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
I ran into complications.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
I'm all ears, good buddy.
Yeah, but...
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
So, Bill, if I understand this right, you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Right now? A six man security force, plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
He's giving them up?
Mortal.
You're sure?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
...I forgive you Darwin.
Shoot, I appreciate that man.
That's not possible. I told you.
I know his location, we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
D'you talk to'm?
No, what did you say on the machine?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
About what?
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
...I'm sorry...
I am. Yeah.
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
They what? What? No. No. Why?
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
My debrief --
-- will be handled back in --
-- You can and you will.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
I wouldn't go that far.
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
-- never in a million girl --
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
For real?
True?
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
What'd you say?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
What?
What do you want?
Can it work?
You'll end up like me.
No?  Who am I, then?
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Yes.
That's fantastic.
No, she won't.
How quickly?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
He'll let me in.
Is there anybody else here?
That depends.
Rheya.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Probably.
What are you going to report back to Earth?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
Kelvin, you awake?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
Perhaps it did.
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
What do you want?
What are they?
You go home.
What do you mean?
What happened?
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
What does Snow think you should do?
You don't love me.
Can you sleep?
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Rheya.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
Do you?
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
You're lying.  I'm not human.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
Neither did I.
What do I have to do to stop it?
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Yes, you are --
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
When?
Why do you say that?
Followed by non-human manifestations.
Occasionally.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
You all right?
Yeah.
Hmm...
You were reading my Renoir.
How did you know?
So, this could be your last night, huh?
Yeah.
No dog.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Let go!
They called here after you left...
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
You told her?
You don't want to know.
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Oh God, that's great!
I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
Yeah.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
... Mike.
So.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
You're planning to speak?
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
My ass is falling.  It is.
I can still use a gun.
I'd identify him.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
Why?
Coming to bed?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Mike, take it easy...
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
What about when she goes out?
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
You in this with me?
Not Koontz.
Wasn't your fault.
Ever shot anyone?
... Hard?
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Under the table.
Watch your step!
How are things going, pal?
Mom and I got plans.
She's taking singing lessons.
Peter-- you took this picture?
Here you go, Pete.
No, no.
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
I know.
Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Hey, guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
What's in there?
I know.  I've got one too.
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
Don't be pitiful.
Mm-hmm.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Mr. Jameson--
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Thanks, I already ate.
He knew.
Good morning, Liz.
Huh?
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
My my.
Some prep school thing.
Eat alone, gotta read. Social defense tactic 17  Peter, that jacket is foul.  Lose your glasses?
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
Hello, Liz.
Waldos.
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Any sign of our friend?
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
I am old enough to--
I'm a photographer, remember?
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Creation? Or its opposite?
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Need any more help?
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Imagine how I feel.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
Bonkers.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Jawohl.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Any news on Dunbar?
Throws what? How could he have a time bomb?
They ought to be under the barbed wire soon.
Roger.
Coming up.
Who is it?
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Private property, bub.
Nice guy! The Krauts shoot Manfredi and Johnson last night and today he's out trading with them.
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Break it off!
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Then we're all in on it?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
Not you.
Yeah.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
You always think I am a square. I have been to America.  I wrestled in Milwaukee and St. Louis and Cincinnati. And I will go back! The way the war is going I will be there before you!
Why do you do this to me every morning?
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
So what? There's other women!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
To the Brick Kremlin!
What do they always say?
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
I'll open mine now.
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
Cut the horseplay, Harry. What's the matter with you guys?
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
Why the south latrine?
Sometimes I think he is fooling us with that crazy business.
Anybody call?
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
We did it.
What's it add up to you, Sefton?
Right.
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Nothing for Kuzawa?
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
I'll kill you for that!
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
Say, Schulz -- you guys had machine gun practice last night?
Give me the radio.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
Wie hat er's gemacht?
Good morning, Sefton.
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
Who's the guy, Schulz?
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
You heard him.
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
According to our information, the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 39.1 years
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
What do you mean?
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
Do you remember him?
What happened to you?
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
All of us.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
No, no. Thank you.
No, no, it's not. It's better.
That's right.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
No.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Is there a problem?
No, sir.
Understood. That will be all.
Sir, is there anything wrong?
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
It's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies.  But it goes deeper than that, doesn't it? I can sense that Rene meant a great deal to you.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Response?
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
For an instant... A scout class vessel.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
Could it be Spock's?
Hello, sir. It's David.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
Later. Let's go...
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
I don't understand.
I'll go...
Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
None that I can detect, sir.
Mr. Scott...
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Oh, God, sir, I dinna think so...
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
What happened...?
Yes. And I know you.
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
The word, sir?
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
About a dozen officers and men.
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
We are clear and free to navigate.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
David?... David!
Wait! Give me a chance --
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
I -- saw no future --
Yes, I was...
Then, how --
He asked you not to grieve...
... Yes...
... The needs of the many outweigh...
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Bones!...
What must I do?
What you ask is difficult.
So!  Speak!
Share this with no one.
Firing range, sir.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
500 Kellicams!
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
How is that...?
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
That's all you have to say?
Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe...
But what if they went -- nowhere?
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
Is that a poem?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
David. Please.
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I'm Admiral Kirk...
It's a long story.
He's on a build up to detonation!
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
I didn't expect anything.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
They're still running with shields down.
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
We'll lose them if they go in there.
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Time's up, Admiral...
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
We'll be going to warp speed --
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
Give the word, Admiral.
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
Yes, Spock.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
I know of your fondness for antiques.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
I would not presume to debate you.
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
Gentlemen, this isn't --
One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power.
Not enough against their shields.
The prefix code?
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
That's it?
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Spock!
The ship -- out of danger?
... the good of the few...
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
Kirk here.
Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Yes.
Reliant's command...
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
Understood, sir.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
To Earth. To offer testimony.
I would accept that as an axiom.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
No!  No... What did you have in mind...?
What do you mean?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Are you sure?  That's what I thought.
-- That's the general idea.
It doesn't look all that different.
Oh, joy.
Jim, you've got to let me go in there! Don't leave him in the hands of Twentieth Century medicine.
Hi... Busy?
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
... My shoes...
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
... Best shot...?
Guess, Spock. Your best guess.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Damage report!
Like what?
The top of what?
Go ahead. Stun me.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Ohhh<u>kay</u>. I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
Back to San Francisco.
I buy that. What about him?
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
They're gonna hafta take their chances.
Just lucky, I guess.
You're upset about losing the whales.
How will that be done, exactly?
Hm?
Wanna try it from the top?
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Here... In the park?
Steady, now. We need your help.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
But Kirk...
Kirk. They're gone.
... Gone?!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
What kind of spaceship is this, anyway?
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
But you said toxic.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Oh, the complete works of Jacqueline Susan, the novels of Harold Robbins....
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
Exaggerate.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
I meant --
Status?
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
Admiral. Full power is restored.
They did, Admiral.
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
... Aye sir...?
Aye, sir. Descending.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
10 seconds, sir!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Systems report.  Communications?
Nothing... I should never have left him...
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
Stay with me, sir -- I need more power curve...
How long, Scotty?
The explosive override -- ?
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Just use the keyboard...
Transparent aluminum?
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Deceive us?
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
A perfect moment?
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
Jak'tahla?
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Mother and son. You arranged this...?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
Really.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Do machines ever play?
Why not...?
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
Can he breathe under water?
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
She's stabilizing.
Captain, Geordi...?
Yes... that looks like them.
From the mission...
A ship,
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village...
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
What kind of concerns?
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
I don't believe it happened that way.
Fail-safe?
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
You got me, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
Commander, if one of their weapons hits that gas...
Commander, I'm showing two Son'a ships on an intercept course.
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
My name is Sojef, Captain.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
Sir?
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Can you beam him off?
Negative. He's established a security field around the control room...
Why was Data assigned?
What are they interested in...?
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
You haven't done that in a long time...
What you're doing to my neck...
Come in.  Hi.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Montana.  Energize.
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
Are you saying they won't help us?
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
You think they're still up there?
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
Yes...
No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it...
Vulcan?
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
What year is it?
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
I am the Borg.
How serious is the damage?
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed.
Captain --
Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
ATR setting...
Main bus...
Great name. French?
Where in the States?
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Yes.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
There is no invasion...
Did you need something?
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
We?
Friends from Cornell...
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
Life signs?
We're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
Life signs?
Captain?
In twenty-four hours, Zephram Cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in Montana. If I'm right, the Borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
Yes, sir.
Unless you'd like to stay.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
A ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
What the hell is happening, Worf?
What are they doing?
Agreed. Options?
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Right.
Wil... Data was down there.
All right... we've lost control of eight decks... three Cargo Bays... one Shuttlebay.
Riker here.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'd prefer not to be the President to push the button if I can avoid it.
I believe the operation is over.
I'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo - you never know...
You may need assistance, doctor...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Specifically of...?
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Damned clever if you ask me...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
This is fun...
Are you carrying a surgeon?
Retire.
Barely.
My God, what happened here?
What?
And what did they tell you?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Mr. Chekov, take us forward, thrusters only, one half impulse power...
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
You must have cursed yourself, for having programmed our data banks, Lieutenant. Only they revealed something wrong aboard Enterprise.
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Your friends are late...
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
Except us.
Where do we come in?
Getting outside the shield is easy. After that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze. Can you?
Aye, sir.
Kronos, sir?
We're almost at the rendezvous - I thought you'd want to know...
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
I always wanted to try that.
Just the prototype.
According to my information, today.
Me?
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
Where?
What the -
I'M going. You are going to be responsible for getting me out of this. Meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
The peace conference.
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
What's she waiting for?
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Channel open, Captain.
Captain --
WE SURRENDER.
Uhura?
Faith...?
But it was when you tried to persuade me the Captain was guilty that I should have understood.
Direct hit -
I have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port --
And if they're still in place?
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Yes, please continue.
Do you know who I am?
Why?
When was he... created?
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Not tonight, I have work here.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Now, you make a toast.
To new worlds...
Good work. The download?
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
It'll only work for one of us.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Of you?
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
We are being hailed.
Negative.
Why am I looking at me?
Why?
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
Yes.
What purpose does this serve?
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
What is our approximate distance?
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
May I have this dance?
You're speaking of emotional investment?
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
How can you be certain?
This isn't real.
No.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Open a channel.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
Cannon fodder.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
Sir, we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Sir, we're being hailed.
What's this?
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
It's working.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
Yes.
It's not quite the face you remember.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Looking up at the stars.
Yes.
After you, Praetor.
In time, Jean Luc.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
And what of the Enterprise?
Its too late.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
The bond is broken.
How long?
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
Commander Suran, the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Gate three. It's boarding now.
Thank you.
How much are your rooms?
Credit card.
I'll have to run your card off now.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
No.
Stay right there...
Where's that?
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
When can we expect containment?
It's taken on a disguise.
I don't like it, George...
Is that what's affecting your performance?
George... Do you hear me, George?
This is George Fox...
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Please.
Please...
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Which way?
Pancakes.
What?
Gas good?
Go.
I am Jenny Haydn.
No gas.
My... husband.
I am husband?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
What is...  ...Coke?
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
Sun...
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
Yes.
A baby is a new person?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
I do not speak English.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
You want this ticket?
Yes.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Can I have the gun?
Jennyhaydn.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
Yes.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
I don't understand 'friend.'
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
What is hell?
I like this music.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Do you have music up there?
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
I don't want you to be hurt.
What are you saying?
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
You're damn right I am.
What?
Good morning.
Oh, you're pretty...
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Help me!!
Help me!!!
Slow down, slow down.
I'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
Is it for real?
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
Tell him I'm not here.
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
Save us all a lot of trouble.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Bullshit!
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Where are you going?
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Bullshit politics.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
Fuck you.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?
Faith, call me, okay?
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Talk to me about costs, here.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
You were lucky, Max.
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
He's been cooked-off
Is he dead?
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
He's got her up in the room, under guard.  And he's still working the party... acting smooth like nothin's nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work a trade.
What do you mean?
You just did.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
I won't say anything.
So there never was a death squad.
How did you hook up with Faith?
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
I always do.
It's alright.  He means it.
Your sex life?
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
What the fuck are you doing?
Are we having a bad night?
No, you're just trying to get off.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Jesus, Lenny.
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this.
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
Black.  Jack.
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Jesus, Mace.  Back off.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Where we going?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Shit!
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Why?
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
I'm not going.
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
See you downtown.
Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a guy?
Right.  That explains it.
What is that?
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Anybody talk to the press?
Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
What's the bad news?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Hi there.
You have the body?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
Ligature strangulation, just like his victims. A cord, nylon, you can tell by the indentation signature -- again, like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Not bad, huh?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
Yes.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
He said it was a clue?
What?
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Who?
Speck. Harold Speck.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
What I do requires confidentiality.
"Was?"
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
Huh?, sir.
Why did you go to Chicago?
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins?
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Doesn't fit.
That information's being withheld from the media.
They're all criminals?
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
And one other thing.
Huh?
Because you asked him to, stupid.
It's a no-no.
He's called a couple times.
Just routine stuff.
Jesus.
The tattoo?
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
I'd be real careful if I were you.
It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong.
They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead.
But why this pattern?
Yeah, of course.
It's quite advanced.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Low calls him Suspect Zero.
I...
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Yes.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
How's the arm?
Suspect Zero?
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
Who told you about her?
Was it Zero?
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
[You tell me.]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir.
So you're the new meat?
What did you do to end up here?
Four hundred and sixty, sir.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
Yes, sir.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
No.
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
You have to put things in perspective.
It didn't feel that way.
You should call your Grandmother.
...maybe...
Yeah.
I'd say about two weeks.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Like the quiche?
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Just like that?
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
What else?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Anything.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
They're out of Glenlivet.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Oh my God.
...And she's with someone else.
Could you believe it?
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Do you have anything smaller?
Why not?
Who's your booking agent?
It's a rebound.
Well... This is it.
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
...Yeah, but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into...
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
...Which one...?
...Six months.
You know, us.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
You don't call.
Right.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
You want to hit the town tonight?
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Ah, there's the rub...
Charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
Thanks, man.
I'm such an asshole.
Well, you're doing so well...
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
You little bitch!
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
How's it going for you two?
Not well.
You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
You live in such a fantasy world...
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
That's right.
Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
I can't lose more than a hundred.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Double down.
You gotta do it.
Always, baby.
Let's just leave.
She was smiling at how money I am, baby.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
She likes you.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
I know. I know.
...Baby...
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Whatever.
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
No, man. I need to use the phone.
Baby, you'll check them tomorrow.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
She thought you were money.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
That was different.
Don't remind me.
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
This version doesn't have fighting?
Who? Rob?
It's on.
What are you doing?
You looked right at her, baby.
I'm sorry.
We got the digits, baby.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Because he's a bitch.
Now?
You think?
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...shivering...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...honestly...
...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...Sue...
It's on...
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Godfather.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.
You fingered Sonny for the Barzini people.  That little farce you played out with my sister.  Did Barzini kid you that would fool a Corleone?
I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on the head of my children, I'm innocent.  Mike, don't do this to me, please Mike, don't do this to me!
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
Understood.
Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
Then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
He's his own boss, and very competent.
And with prison record.
This morning.
You mean Tattaglia.
Barzini.
What was this for?
For bravery.
And this?
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
No.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
No, I wanted other things for you.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
How do you know I come from America?
Yes.
You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight. 
Mike!  The party starting!
Who are those girls?
Give them some money and send them home.
Mike!
If Luca sold out we're in real trouble.
No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Mike, why am I out?
Did he give you his politicians?
I've never seen anything like it.
Who is he?
You really want to know?
Michael you're trying to scare me...
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
What time do they expect us?
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
Absolutely not!  We have to get permission from the Doctor.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
All right, Sonny.  All right.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Where are you going?
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
Cut it out.
Go on Mike.
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
What is it?
Do you renounce Satan.
I do renounce him.
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Is he alive?
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
Uncanny!
Hi Tom.
I'll come down.
You'd say if you mind?
Marge, you like everybody.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
I met him in New York.
What?
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
I could fuck this icebox I love it so much.  What were you actually doing in New York?
I played piano in a few places.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
No, no brothers, no sisters.
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Shoes too?
...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
That's good.
Why?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
What?
So tell me.
What evening?
Hello?
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Tom.
I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom. Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you.
I just don't believe that!
Such as?
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does. Marge, she's got a hundred theories, but there are a few things she doesn't know. We hope she never knows.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
I never said that!
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
So I'm learning.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Ha. Did he say why?
What does that mean?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Tom?
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
Marge? Where are you going?
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I told you. He gave them to me.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
We think he's had a change of heart.  So we should be celebrating.
So you found Peter...
What's funny?
Excuse me?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
What?
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
Hello Meredith.
Just kidding. Are you alone?
You know what -- I am.
All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
And tomorrow?
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
That's good, isn't it?
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
What do you want to change about this moment?
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
What do you mean lied about who you are?
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Postmortem?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even her.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance?
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Absolutely.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
All right.  All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
The moon?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
You know what you remind me of?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
What are you doing?
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
This is sort of high class...
...there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Yeah.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
More people watch it.
Just what?
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Oh, are you all right?
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Yeah.
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Iris.
I don't remember.
Listen...
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
I can leave anytime I want.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Well, you want to or not?
Who's a killer?
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
You just gonna leave 'em?
What should I do? Call the cops?
Cops don't do nothin.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
You don't have to.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
No Sir.
Got your license?
There's porno theatres for that.
Age?
So I hear.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
Anything you say, officer.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
So howsit?
Yeah?
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
Real down.
I know.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
He's got a gun, sir.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I don't understand....
You suppose?
Motor oil?
Don't shoot me. Mason was actually slinging it over his shoulder...
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
You mean,  me?
Do you... remember me?
You look... different.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
City hall?
You first.
Whoa.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
We were in love... weren't we?
Nothing.  
Do you have the...
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
When did you start smoking?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Sir, that is true.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
I... I need a drink of water.
Here we are.
Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory.
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
No.  But...
But what?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
We've been closed for a while.
Why?
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Yes.
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Did you... did you...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
A few.
Pete.  You think maybe you've had enough?
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
What's wrong?
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Jesus.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
I... I don't believe this.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Cat.  That's simple.  I like it.  Hi, Cat.
Please, sit.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
The war...
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Yes.
Yes.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Thank you.
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
How'd you happen to come here?
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
When was this?
A trifle.
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
She already has a daughter.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Cathy!
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here?
I know.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Why are they trying to kill people?
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
The little Brenner girl.
It's Alice, ain't it?
Good morning.
I wonder if you could help me.
Do you know him?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Mmmm.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Where would I get a boat?
D'you want me to order one for you?
I wonder if you could tell me...
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
How much for the phone calls?
Young woman cut herself.
Gulls!
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
No. Here's fine. 
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
How long have you known her?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Tell him about the party.
I don't know.
When?
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
But they'll be back.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
What?
No.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you like me to go for her?
That's a chimney swift, all right.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
These birds were...
Does this room look silly?
He was killed last night. By birds.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
I understand completely, sir.
Aren't these lovebirds?
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Some of them are.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
We met in court.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
I didn't break that window!
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
Do you practice here?
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
What did it say?
Right next to the one you already had.
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
I'm sure.
Famished.
Oh, yes.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Yes.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
No.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
It is for me.
Helping travelers.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
Some cream?
Really? Tell me about it.
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
So they united.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
It's so damn quiet out there.
Melanie...
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Mitch...
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
And he'll talk?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
That... that... who was that?
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by. 
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
For what purpose?
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
Were the Santa Rosa police at your school today?  Are you coming?
Mr. Gray?
Ask this one favor --
It's not because of Georgina -- because of Dr. MacFarlane's failure?
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
I've heard of it.
He's not home.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
But this woman -- and her son --
I remember her.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Gray killed her.
We can't be sure of that.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
She's unconscious.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
I know it -- I know it -- The moment I was rid of him --
What?
Are you a doctor, too?
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.
A doctor?
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
I'll not do it, Gray.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
I brought you something tonight, MacFarlane -- an interesting specimen -- in very good condition.
This is a gift you'll not return.
So, Toddy, you've made me a disease, eh?
Only Brother.
Burke them?
I come from Lisbon.
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
Nearly a year.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
You've been with Gray again.
Can I get you something? A glass of water? A transfusion?
You're wrong.
Tell her... we'll get him.
That was a fucking hollow point!
Think maybe knives do?
Where the fuck did you come from?
Wrong. Answer.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
He didn't kill her.
I told you, I knew your sister.
This is where it happened. Right over here.
So you're going to kill him?
Erin. Who?
... it connects you to me...
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
You know.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Could say that.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
I do. Every day.
What's with your friend there?
If you had a license, I bet I'd have seen it by now. How old are you? Fifteen?
I want you... to bend over.
What were you yelling about?
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
You're in with them.
It's not what you think.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
I would never hurt you or Lauren. Never. Believe me.
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Maybe a little demonstration.
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Hi Mom!
What do you mean, dear?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
Where is that?
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Gee! How could they make a landing?
You think they'll ever find him?
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
What does that mean?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
No foolin'? Will you?
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
Just Klaatu.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
The present situation?
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
It was a wonderful day.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
You ready?
I will be in just a minute.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Is it real?
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
How do you know?
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
What is it you want?
Just twelve.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
I -- I thought you were--
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
No. That's all finished.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
Just passing through Santa Carla?
I don't like horror comics.
Can't stand light?
He's my brother.
They're gaining on us!
All together?
The Prince of Darkness.
Death to all vampires!
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Don't!  Stop!
What is this, David?
For a ride.
With him?
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
Oh, no...
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Are we havin' fun or what?
I thought we were goin' into town.
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
We are...
Wait a minute, kiddo.
We're getting close...
Ocean air!
Tell them to get something to eat.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Lights out, Sam.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Mom!
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Max!  What's wrong?
Something the matter?
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Does it burn?
Okay.  Talk.
Hi...
Star.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
Me, too.
I'm Michael.
I guess you're new around here.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Now you and David...
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Because I love you...
You've got to put this on.
Take laddie.
Where are we going?
Do I have to do this?
What would that make Mom?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you?
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Sixteen.
What do you mean "got" to the dog?
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
How you doin', old boy?
What?
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
MacReady!
Look, I'm just guessing...
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
What for?
I guess you're okay.
In this weather?
How long will it take you to prepare this?
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
Right.  Why not?
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Look, if you're going to keep bitching, MacReady -- Palmer's offered to take him up...
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
We going to make it?
This storm do that?
What are you going to do?  Drink it?
So what do you make of it?
We should sleep in shifts.
It's the generator I think!  No power.
He's one of them.
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
What do you do on the towers?
On the towers?
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
The Hall of Books.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
... Well, you wanted to see it.
Sir... have you a name?
You know of them?
Do you know where they live?
Because you'll never die.
When was his mother taken?
Send him away.
Yes...
This is the way in?
Vox?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
This has to end.
Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
I won't leave you like this.
I don't understand.
Alexander.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
No, we created the Morlocks.
Created?
They survived above.  Became what they are.
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
I know.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
May I help you?
Why is it -- breaking up?
I need to... um... talk to you.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
A moonstone.
Got here as soon as I could.
Alex, what is it?
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
I was not.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
In the future, we'll be better.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
You wouldn't believe me.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
Yes.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
Oh, that explains everything.
Why?
Why not?
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Yes.
All of you?
What's it all for?
I don't understand.
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Alexander...?
You lost someone.
Is it?
It's undamaged?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
It was different then.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
May I get you some --
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Imagine that.
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
I am the oldest.
Where do they take them?!
We have to go after them, find where -- !
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
Then it's time to change that --
If I might explain, sir --
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
They're inside --
And you've no idea where he went?
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
We never should have done this to him...
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
I need to get this letter to someone.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
[Beat] What?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
It's December 25th, 1993 today.
What?
I don't believe a thing she just said.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
They're not here.
They're not.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
Where are we going?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I don't understand.
I could try to...make it stop.
My God you look exactly like him.
What case?
[Beat] I don't know.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
You don't understand.
Well, what time is it?
The future doesn't look different?
What about the world?
Because I don't have time.
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
How...how do you know?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
I tried to kill my wife.
I wasn't talking about anything.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it, don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
You ever been to jail?
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?
Where are you going?
Can you drive?
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
Well, where are you from?
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
What's this?
This is pretty good. Considering...
So you're a waitress, right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
How?
Uh-huh.
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
Honey?
Why?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
On what?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Who's the nut?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law?
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
I've been better.
You girls are in some hot water.
Hey.
How are things goin' out there?
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Alright.
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
I have no problem with that.
I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
How?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
You're in Oklahoma?!
Not yet.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
It's a place called Shaw's Siesta Motel.  The address is 1921 North East 23.  It's under your name.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Will you at least see how it fits?
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Are you just doin' this to punish me?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Am I in trouble?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me.  Hi.  What'd he say?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
Okay.  I will, too.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
Whose place is this again?
Thelma!
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Oh my God.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Why are you actin' like this?
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...!  Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet.  Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to watch him go.
Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
Drive!  Drive away!
Holy shit.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
What for?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
I... I...
Idaho?
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
You mean now or before?
I can see that.
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
This is so beautiful.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
What?
What?!  What about him?!
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
What'd I say again?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Me too.  I feel awake.
We can live in a hacienda.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
We've gone insane.
How far are we from Mexico?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
What?!
Where?!
God!  It looks like the Army!
What?  What are you talkin' about?
You women are crazy!
We're fine!  How are you?
Oh, Jesus!
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
He implied it.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Good-looking?
It must be great with a wife like that.
I don't know.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Mary's a babe!
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
You know, clean the pipes.
Why's that?
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Huh.
Jesus Christ you're right.
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
So... I see you made the news.
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
Here's the info you asked for.
Thanks.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Healy, what I just tell you?
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
You own a home there?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
Same here again.
How'd you know that?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Lint?
You're a movie buff?
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
So...
Come on, what were you going to say?
Fuck!!
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Well, I know you're busy...
No.
You can't be serious.
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
Four kids, three different guys.
Three different guys?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
What are you doing?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Mary's a mail-order bride?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
Your turn?
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
What do you mean?
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
And you met Mary how?
What?
You were following us?
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
It means you're too hard on guys.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Have you been up all night again?
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
What's a mook?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
What's up, Doc?
You don't think they're too big?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
The prom -- you going?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
Oh... are you... ?
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
You look great.
What's that?
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
Yeah?
Well... why don't you move back?
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Mary, come on...
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
One guess.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
No, no, please!
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Hey.
So what's up?
Eh.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Uh-huh.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
How does a guy get a rep like that?
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
My father --
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
That is correct.
An invasion...
When are you going to be home?
I want an hour with him.
Hey, sport. You winning?
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
I don't care. Cancel it.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Just a second, Mr. President.
Hey.
Rug samples.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
I see.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal Division.
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
What journey?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
What the hell you doing?!
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
Were you in Nam?
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
How'd you know?
I'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
Her oil pan is shot.
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
Bastards...
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Tread matches. It's the car.
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
What are you --
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I'm giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you're here, you're gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.
What's he smoke in that?
He also said "listen to the water."
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
What'd you expect to hear?
What you call myths, we call our history.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
You think you was sent here cuz you're a good cop?
We've driven a long way. Where is this place?
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
1868...
What?
This Clear Moon's house?
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
Who did?
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
I read, Cooch.
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
No way. No fuckin' way.
How the hell do you know?
I'll bet!
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
That's a big comfort to me.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
It would have been really embarrassing!
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
Yes, ma'am.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
Um. You.
Yes. I'll give you that!
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Lieutenant...
Evan... or Maverick.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
What about the plane?
What plane.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Just good luck.
I was flying...my responsibility.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
You don't have to do this.
I want it back.
You don't believe that.
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
Goose is dead.
I was, later.
F-14's sir.
Remember one thing.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
Let's hope you're right!
He better be kidding!
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
What is?
What?  What is it?
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
Saving them some paperwork.
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
Okay, okay.
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
I've got it -- hold on!
5000 feet. Speed two hundred.
Just relax.
You're not supposed to...
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
What do you want?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Like what?
Got you here.
That's not what I heard.
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
Tom Kazansky.
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
You ever done this before?
What what are you doing? We're cover!
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
What'd you do?
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
Well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
A plaque?
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
ON THE NOSE?
Figured it out yet?
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
So have I.
Three guesses.
It was bad.
Morning, Coogan.
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
Why?
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
I can take care of myself.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
No bother.
Or you can quit.
I don't know...
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
First time on Mars?
Need a ride?
Would you like the same suite?
Hmm.  It seems you left something in our safe.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
Fuck you.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
So why am I still alive?
I didn't want it to end this way.  I wanted Hauser back.  But nooo.  You had to be Quaid.
He had help.  From our side, sir.
But I thought...
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
I'm with an very important client.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Amazing.  Where are we?
You're strapped into an implant chair, and I'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
You open it.
Suppose I do...then what?
Quaid!  That's Quaid!
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
Where's Kuato?
You tell me.
They found us!  Everybody out!
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
No shit...
Harry!
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
I want that fucker dead.
Shit!
I've got a lock!  There!
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Who is she?
Nobody.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
I don't know.
Do what?
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Lori, move.
Oh God, Doug.
Not talk!  I said TALK!!
It was implanted by the Agency.
The job's real. -- But the Agency set it up.
I love you.
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
What's in the two week package?
Come on, don't bullshit me.
All right.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!
What's he talking about?
I love you.
Hauser left me a note.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Forget I said wife.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
I said get out!
The first settlers are buried here. They worked themselves to death, but Cohaagen ended up with all the money. He built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
He's lying.
Where's this "reactor" come from?
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Ready as we'll ever be.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Knock it off, Burt!
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
She's got my vote.
We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
Why?
Tammy Lynn Baxter.
You're full of shit.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
Jesus!  I don't <u>believe</u> this!
Fuck you!
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
You want the rifle or the Smith?
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
What the hell are they?
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
You go north, I'll go south.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Its tires are flat...
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Use the fucking bomb!
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
What?
Burt!  Heather!
The con...!  Oh my God.
I don't believe this.  The phone is out!  Pham, your phone is out!
Twenty.
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
Yeah, geography.
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
What's it doing?
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
It most certainly is.
Ms. Vin's sister.
Your Honor, that's not fair -- !
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
You can't remember that -- !
How can you remember that?
We had a description of the suspect.
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
We have a full caseload, Rog.
-- a speed manufacturer --
So go take your job on Wall Street.
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
What other case?
Some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists. The mayor pressures the cops. The cops pressure the rival gang -- the Joe Boys. The Joes give up Shu Kai Kim -- the schmuck kid from Korea who's been pestering 'em to get in.
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
When did you start working for the goddam D.A.?
A Complaint Follow-Up form.
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
1530 Rivington Street.
But what?
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
I think he hired Shu to kill Jimmy Chin... It wasn't a Chinatown gang hit -- Jimmy Chin and Art's wife were lovers! She just about told me...!
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Murder witness.
Stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward, Kitty. Y'oughta start looking for the others...
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
I embroidered.
The Joe Boys in 1980...!
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
I don't need sleep!
Want to tell me what went down here?
Exactly what happened then?
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
You tell me, man.
No. You tell me, Shu.
How can I tell you what I don't know!
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
-- How could I help you?
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
Isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
Didn't this investigation, with its attendant publicity, catapult you into the office you now hold?
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
No.
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Look. Mister --
-- Roger --
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
Five years.
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
For control of the prison drug trade?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
A basic kill. Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. My boys have been all over this. It's a dead end.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Can you tell me what their names were?
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley. Sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.
Was there an argument?
Not that I know of. But arguments do happen, don't they?
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
OK, Gordon.
OK, Gordon.
GOT A MAP OF THE ENVIRONS OF THE YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION WITH YOUR NAME ON IT. BETTER BRING A POLE.
GOOD LUCK, CHET.  SAM, YOU STICK WITH CHET, HE'S GOT HIS OWN M.O. MODUS OPERANDI.  YOU CAN REACH ME AT THE PHILADELPHIA OFFICES. I AM FLYING OUT TODAY.
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
The later events have never been kept a secret.
Where's Hap?
He's dead -- good and dead.
Did she ever mention any friends?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
What happened to her?
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
How do you figure?
Lil was wearing a sour face.
What did Gordon's tie mean?
What? That's just Gordon's bad taste.
That's what I heard.
I don't know, Sam.
What is it?
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
When?
He probably wanted to drive over.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Call me.
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
What are you doing?
I won't wear your stuff.  I promise.
No.
What can I tell you?
Why do you do it, Laura?
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Who would do that?
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
Laura, you have to deal with all of this.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
Laura, do you love me?
Why? It does.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
You know it and I know it.
Everything, but everything.
You mean the ones you pity.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
What?
Trees?
Josie, I think we should go public.
Fish eyes?
I'm sorry, Mom.
...school's fine...
Let me see.
Dad?
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Did you get this from your lover?
Soon. How about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
What are you doing?
Who am I?
I don't know.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
Very good.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
...tell me about this case.
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
You thought it was just.
You know what that would mean?
What does it mean?
I...
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
They lied.
That's not my handwriting.
No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State...
No.
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Objection!
Yes.
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
Hold on a second.
It's all right, Mickey.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
...What difference would...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No, you did fine.
The Doctors were not negligent.
Why is that?
I am on the staff of...
She getting good care over there?
Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
And you wrote that...
Right. Who called?
Her doctors killed her.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Who told you that?
Kathy Price...
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I need an extension for my case.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Why?
I'm a lawyer.
A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
And are they going to get it?
Is this a bad time.
What happened...?
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
Do you think it's my fault?
You're talking like a drunk.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
You're pressuring yourself...
No.
Mr. Alito, please.
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
Mr. Galvin's...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
No.
Nothing happened.
And ask me what?
I didn't do it, Mister.
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
...I know. I went...
...You saw her?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
Another, Frank...?
I want to buy you a drink.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
Uh...
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Right.
Been a long time, huh...?
So what?
Today is Tuesday. What?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
How are you holding up?
I'm swell.
Are you with me... are you awake...?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
...one of the other nurses?
What did she do?
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
I just saw her.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, that's correct.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
What happened in those three...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
Yes.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
I do know him...slightly.
How does it happen cars are running?
Good to see you, General.  This is Pastor Collins, director of Civil Defense.  Sheriff Bogany, head of the local forces ... Miss Van Buren.
Can you handle one of these?
You'll hit something!  Can't you go higher?
Is that... machine...?
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
So is the town, I notice!
My orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there.
They don't do much of anything...!
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
The nightmares.
Can I read it?
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
He's had some sort of...episode.
What?  What kind of episode?
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
Ms. Langenkamp.  I suggest you go home and get some rest.  Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
Very well. As soon as we gather the appropriate papers...
Someone's coming.
Tomorrow night.
Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep tight.
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
Do you have to die to see God?
Home.
You okay, champ?
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
Dylan, where's the man?
You okay?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Yeah...how'd you know?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
You're not crazy, by the way.
You didn't jump in.
Seemed, not was.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
I know how Chase really died.
Yes?
I want to see the body.
Studio B.
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
The car's no there yet?
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
Like the Genie in the bottle.
Me?  Why me?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.  How are you?
Did we lose anybody?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
I haven't forgotten.
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
Come in.
Fifteen.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
It didn't go over 'til I turned her starboard!
There's still a way.
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
I know.
Figured what out?
That's not why he's sending me.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Is it true Phil?
I gotta go.
You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
What the hell is going on?
Fine.
I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
So... What happened?
My parents don't do it anymore.
Where are you from any way?
It was so real...
Who?
Of a fight he can't win out here.
They have every right Chuck.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
I should be eating with the crew.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
You do?
Yes sir.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!
That's enough.
We'll think of something.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
How would you know?
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
Why, man?
I don't.
What do you think?
Fuck off man.  It's just a fish.
You're the one who doesn't care, Phil.
What are we supposed to talk about?
I'm not gonna kill it.
Are you hating this?!  Are you!
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
They are much more than that, sir.
... Absolutely not.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
What's that supposed to mean?!
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
This be it?
You an indian?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Forty bucks...
You heard from Reggie?
Used to.
What'd you say?
Club Zanzibar.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Oh, many things...
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
You are from New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local shrimp boat captains is in jail now. These people are friends of mine, so I must return and find out what happened.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
What?
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
That bastard Pucinski...
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
You ain't actin', mama.
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Here she goes again...
Sailor?
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
Actin' funny how?
Hell, peanut...
What's that?
So?
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
Come look at this.
What's that, honey?
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
Huh?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
You think he saw us?
Who knows, baby?
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
Yeah, I'm here.
Trust me on it.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
Fan works.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Anything I can do for you?
Sailor? You know what?
And Bobby too, I hear...
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Just a place.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Got any plans?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Where? In the leg?
In the head.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Life is unpredictable.
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
You snore.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
She's a transvestite.
He said something about being between things.
Is that just beer?
He has a book.
I know. He started it Fall semester.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Tripp.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
What's to tell?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Excuse me?
I passed out.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
The last month maybe.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
She told you about...
Better luck next time.
Vernon.
Move away, cupcake. He's got a gun.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Boy or girl?
Sure.
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
You're in Kinship?
Yes. But that's not why I called...
...reconcile with Emily.
Trust me, I understand. I just want to say something to you, Grady.
Yea?
It's very convincing.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
A little.
So what are you doing out here?
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.
That's really it.
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
You?
Whose tuba is that anyway?
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
The guy on the phone.
What'd he say?
What'd you tell him?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
How did I get here last night?
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like.
Where's that?
Outside Scranton.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
When we fall, we fall hard.
I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions.
Maybe she didn't come here.
I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy?
What?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
It's warm.
You're lying.
The hell I am.
I never said that.
Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack?
Want a bite?
No thanks.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
I eat.
When?
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Near Carvel?
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
But where? I need the street.
Chancellor.
I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
I'm sure.
Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Is the thing -- is it over?
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Oh?
Someone stole my car.
Would Walter really press charges?
He told you.
I'm through improvising.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
I lost it all.
Does he still love you?
That's a nice greenhouse.
Who's he barking at now?
Tony. Now that I'm home.
He's writing his name in water.
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
This is important.
Oh?
Excuse me?
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
I was thinking of you.
And?
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
Where you stand?
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
Hardapple?
No, the dog.
George Sanders?
There's so many...
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
I was just thinking of... the noise.
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
How is she?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
How old is Anna?
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Fucking Mariners.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
What party?
Aren't you glad?
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
I'm just talking, man.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
You always carry these?
Try.
I can't.
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
Hiya, Walter.
What's up?
I haven't broken any laws.
I would.
Do you believe in them?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
You knew her?
You don't know?
He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
The passionate one?
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
So. How are you adjusting?
It gives me headaches.
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
What?
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
Just trying to be helpful.
No thank you.
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Does he?
Ms. Kramer.
Your daddy will always love you.
It's getting dark. Go home.
You seem a little hostile today.
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
A diary?
That's right.
Ev-i-dence.
Of course.
Try it.
No fucking way.
How's the journal?
I'm still thinking about it.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
Forget it.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
I don't feel anything.
I'm not that crazy.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
I mean, when will I be normal.
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
You're very late.
Close your eyes.
What?
Why?
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
Sorry.  Where is she?
In my bedroom, sleeping.
Where are you?
But roughly, how old?
And what are you doing?
A nap?
Did you get an erection?
What?
I'm all right.
There's something wrong with this picture.
What picture?
Very weird.
What's weird about that?
You never spoke to me before.
Is that a school?
What?
Something happened to you.
So... what's your dark secret?
What?
No you're not.
It's been a while since...
The morning?
I thought I'd stay the night.
Did I say something wrong?
So, what did you do?
I molested little girls.
Sorry.
What did you do to them?
It's not what you think.
Twelve years in prison?
Why don't you just go now, okay?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
You don't really --
Sounds like a special guy.
Their power. They seduce me.
Nothing. It's over.
Most people say the odds are against me.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
I love my brothers.
Do what?
Do you want to talk about it?
I heard they were filthy birds.
Goddamnit!  D'you tell him we need it right now?
You done impressing yourself, ace?
Lord Almighty.
I can't believe you let them do this!
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
No.
Hippy, just relax.  You're making the women nervous.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
He's jammed the mechanism.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You got it on, keep it on.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Virgil?
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
Hippy, you pussy.
Quiet!  Quiet!
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth. We're checked out.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Cab One, radiation readings?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Radiation is nominal.  The warheads must still be intact.
How many are there?
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
What kind of light?
Would we see the flash?
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
But you just said that a month was too...
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
This one is gorgeous.
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
Are you feeling better?
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
And what about you?
Are you joking?
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
What! Get married?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
Then I'll see you later.
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Have you ever been in love?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
But for what reason should I come there?
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
There too...
Claudia, I know how you feel, but there are already two of us staying...
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Why don't you try?
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
You really must do me this one favor.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
Because...
Who told you this?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
No.
I burnt them.
Yes, Mother.
Should you see a doctor?
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Who?
Who?
You've been alone together?
Often?
Oh, yes.
No. I was sick.
What baby?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
Martha Louise Livingston.
No.
No questions.
No... do you?
Somebody told her.
Agnes...
Did your mother see angels often?
Why not?
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
What the child?
And you're unhappy.
You can tell me.
I can't.
She can.
How?
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Yes.
Why?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
No I'm not.
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Agnes, you're stupid.
Because I'm in trouble.
It came out of me.
Yes.
Why?
Yes.
Will she be angry?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
What is it?
A wastepaper basket.
No.
Yes.
What do you do?
Of what?
Who?
Do you remember what just happened?
Yes.
How did she know about him?
Where?
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
No...
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
Yes.
For what he made me go through.
It was alive wasn't it?
Yes.
Yes.
You saw it all didn't you?
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Larry...
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
You have proof?
When?
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Oh that one there, in the corner.
Yes.
Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
No-one.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
None as far as I know.
Yes, but I...
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
Who?
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
She has it now.
You hate us don't you?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
???  
There's another choice.
Oh, some time in January.
Visitors to the convent.
What is it?
Yes.
Listening to angels?
Don't deny it!
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Because I am a moral person.
You just said...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
Pipe!
Become?  One is born a saint.
May I be present?
You're what?
For Agnes.
The father!
But how did it happen?
Who was that person Mother?  Was it you?
Who knew she was pregnant?
No!
I left it with her and I went for help.
Lay them down.
I'm a deserter.
Oh, it's all right.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
We're nearly there, sir.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
Are you going in?
You do - repeatedly.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'll have a bash.
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
Get him out of here!!
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
We do.
He hasn't.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
Sorry.
How'd you guess?
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Is it ... is it, really?
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
They ought to be.
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Why selfish?
Is she?
Books are good!
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
You're only right.
Where are you off to?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
What's he on about?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Yeah ... so what?
Anything to spare?
No, that's his other one.
Is that yours?
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
Hiding.
How d'you reckon that one out?
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Let's go and muck in.
You won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
You needn't bother.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Now get on with it.
We were going to do it.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
Leave him alone, he's got swine fever.
Leave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.
Hi Norm!
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Hello.
My eyes are lighter.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Is it?
Oh, leave off!!!
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Aren't we ...
Stop picking on him.
He's been gone a long time.
Who?
Paul's grandfather.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Oh... God... am I cold...
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
There could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it.
... I don't know...
I got it.  Oh boy.
Can you get it a little closer?
Activate lifter quads.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
What's the terrain down there?
Then take her down.
Close enough to walk to!
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
I'll go first.
Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
What is it?
Okay, I'm in the mouth of the chimney now, and I'm starting down.
Don't you remember?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Computer, what language was that?
Yes!
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Computer!  I've turned all the cooling units back on!  What's wrong?
What?
It grows on you.
Okay.
Where does that go?
Oh, no.  Oh, no.
And then we run out of food and oxygen.
That one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets -- you notice?  The food storage room on one end --
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
This dust is getting clogged in the intakes again!
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
No, I don't want us separated.
He wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Yes.
I think I could cobble something together.  A long metal rod with a battery in it.  Give it a hell of a shock.
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
Oh my God.
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
I've completely lost their signal.
No.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
How many?
This is horrible.
That must have been when he got it.
What common objects?
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
That way.
How far?
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
It won't come -- it's stuck.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
My God, it's stormy for a piece of rock that size!
We do know that.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Anything else?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Hey, can you guys hear me?
Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
You hear me, Martin?  Open the outer door.
I'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place, Martin.  We never should have landed here.
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies.
We won't need it then.
Food-storage room!
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
Now what?
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
Which presumably means...
It was time for that a couple days ago.
No, it won't work and I just realized why.  There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
I'll get you out of there.
No... don't...
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Better?
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Thanks.
How many of them are there?
Give or take.
And?
Shit.  When?
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
When?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Deal.
Listen to what?
Something spooking the rhinos?
Hey, Guttierez?
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Whoa, wait a minute...
But I'm going first...
How?
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Okay.
And...?
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
They've changed their heading again.
Thanks.
Okay, we're in business.
Okay, I'm out of here!
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Seltzer?
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Jesus.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
Phoebe.
Please do.
That's right.
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
You take charge.
Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
Just like that, eh?
I don't think that's funny.
It wasn't meant to be.
What a day - what a heavenly day...
Aren't you?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
I didn't mean just the Theater.
You have no right to say such things!
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
What do you mean by that?
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
A dull cliche.
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
No-no-no...
Yes, Addison.
You can have one at Max's.
Because I don't want to.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
Let's go sit by the piano.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
Then you've heard too.
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
Margo.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington...  Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
It could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it...
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Frankly, I don't remember.
Just slipped your mind.
I take it she read well.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Bill!
You've already met.
When? When are you going to do it?
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
Take care of yourself out there...
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
And cut that out right now.
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
I love you...
It's a good thought.
Happy little housewife...
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Looks like I'm going to have a very fancy party...
That never stopped you before.
So she seems.
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
Okay. Mix.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
Now don't get carried away-
Paranoiac!
It's not nonsense.
What would you like? Texas?
A cowboy.
Why what?
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
It's only one picture deal.
So few come back...
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
Everything.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
You think?
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
What did you expect - live sables?
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
Of course!
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Like an agent with one client.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
You all put together?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Late for what?
What are you doing here?
That's all.
Probably not.
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
How long does it take?
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
He's the best.
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
Don't get up.  And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
- an understudy's performance.
He can help you.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
Over my dead body...
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
If you'd like.
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Why not?
It's the tight girdle that does it.
You've what?
She's just outside the door.
Margo, really...
How much time have we?
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
What about Bill?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Margo.  Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
I just can't believe it.
With tears?
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
That's on time for Margo.
It's just possible she didn't...
What time is it?
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
Eve?
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
If we could cast it properly, that is...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
With gestures, of course.
Now just a minute-
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize...
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen?
Where is she?
Who's left out there?
How do you mean?
Margo, you haven't got any age.
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
That's beside the point.
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
It's been quite a night. I understand that your understudy - Miss Harrington - has given her notice.
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
You know, she probably means well, after all...
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
That's right, but I don't understand-
But that was the fourth straight time.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck. It's friends that count. And I got friends.
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
You get quick action, don't you?
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Well...
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
I promise.
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--no way--
Carl?
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
--a spy, you mean?
That was fun.  What now?
--see?--
See her?  Get anything?
For the paper, no; for us, plenty.  I waited a long time and finally this big guy--I guess a bodyguard-- he left and I knocked and she remembered me, we talked awhile.
And?--And?--
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
I never scared anyone before.
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
Go on, go on--
Look--five men controlled that slush fund as CREEP--three of them we've got, Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, and we're pretty sure of Kalmbach.
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
Segretti criss-crossed the country over ten times in six months--and never stayed anyplace over a night or two.  Switch to another station, huh? You're driving me crazy with that.
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
What would you have done?
--That cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the Democrats--five guys had control--
What if I went up and introduced myself--think he'd slug me?
It's nothing personal, though. 
--Sloan told the Grand Jury--he answered everything they asked him-- that means there's a record somewhere--
I finally got through to Sloan--it was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the Grand Jury about Haldeman, he was ready to, only nobody on the Grand Jury asked him the goddamn question.
--jeeeeeeesus--
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
--Howard Hunt?
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.
I'm so glad.
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
--you got more than one source?--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
I thought you had to get to Miami.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
You've really got to go.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
...No... never in so many words...
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
--it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
Go on.
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
I got Clawsen on hold--
--what do you think?--
We can't talk inside either?
Are you implying you don't believe me?
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
...you're definitely doing a story...?
That twenty-five thousand dollars is money I collected for Nixon in this year's campaign.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
To where?
They know, but they focused on the burglary--if it didn't deal with the break-in, they didn't pursue it.
Mitchell knew then.
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
How grand?
--I know, I know, the pressure's off the White House and it's all back on the Post--
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
--yes, yes, what is it?
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Your name, please.
...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
I think so.
Are you sure?
It may never come out.
But it's possible.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
Where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
I never asked them about Watergate. I only said what were Hunt's duties at the White House. They volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--has any of them got an ax?--
--and he says Chapin hired Segretti--
Mr. Sloan?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
Go on.
--and it wasn't Ehrlichman or Colson or the President.
Sorry.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
I'll do it.
Thanks coach.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Why is this?
Charming.
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Of course, I didn't --
You can call me Ostreicher.
What's your middle name?
Neither will I.
Nice car.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
What?  No I'm not.
Why are you doing this?
Uh...my dad's the manager.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
So you're going to Michigan?
You want onions?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
You can't sing at the competition.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
What about the game?!
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
What's that?
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Jessica, can you drive me home?
You got it, stud.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Give it to me!  Yes!
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Pontificated.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Hey, minuteman.
How do you know that?
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Yes.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
Yes.  Seriously.
Okay, I get it.
This'll do.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
Who cares?
I still think you're okay.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
Well.  You have seen me.  Now it is my turn to see you.  Strip.
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
You are done, James.  Perhaps I should be going now.
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Tonight?
I think "shithead" really says it.
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
Like how?
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
You want to do it?
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
But you don't love me.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
Yeah, are you?
Me too.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
I want to hear you say it.
Victoria...I love you.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
Say that again, Kevin?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Either way works for us...
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Salots! Shitfucker!
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
Andy! Holy shit!
Fan-fucking-tastic?
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
They're coming!
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Are you crazy!?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
What...?
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
You on drugs? Huh?
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Psychic awareness. Right.
Andy...
Yeah?
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Uncle Terrence.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Because Gaston was after it.
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Where is it! Please!
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Andy!
Here.
Well?
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Where is your home, Anya?
Is everyone all right?
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
You never thought of the possibility?
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
I'm going to stretch my legs
Come on up!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
Come on!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
Dmitri?
Don't let me go!
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
Hurry up with those papers.
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
What do you mean?
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
I should go
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
Who are you?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
It's okay.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Tsch.
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
The alarm clock.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Right!  Where?
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
Huh?
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
Don't be funny.
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Your grammy!
Well...
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
You sure?
Oh, yeah.
Duane?
Why not?
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
it's my first time.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Hey, listen, listen.
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
No.  You're a wreck.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
Good? I was-
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah?
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't you think I do?
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
You don't want me to live with you?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
How is it any different?
What are you doing?
Were you always funny?
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
I didn't follow you!
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Whatta you mean? Me?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
David! David! I can't believe this!
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Oh. What?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
Thing?
yes, we had, uh...
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
God.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Remember that day?
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Thanks, honey.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Okay.  Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
This is my room.
What'd I do?
Step up here!
What'd I do?
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Why are you so hostile?
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
What-
Oh, you got a headache!
Man, that's great. That's just great.
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
You know, it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another. You know what I'm talking about?
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Hey.
Mean?
May I see your license, please?
Just give me the license, please.
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
You're crazy!
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Ah, Max, you, uh...
We can show her the schoolyard.
I have some very good memories there.
What's the matter?
I don't know, I mean, I-
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
Look at you, you-you're such a clown.
I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, but our relationship doesn't seem to work anymore.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
M'mmm.
Oh.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
So who won?
Why didn't you come in?
Would it make a difference?
Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal.
She's a constant surprise.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
I have a small window of time.
She already has.
You don't have any clothes on.
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Just don't fucking tell her.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Take good care of it.
I'm the hired help.
Anymore.
That for us?
Can I open it?
Just did.  Jealous?
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
The suspense is killing me.
Harry called.
And?
She left a note.
Leave us alone right now.
Monica.
He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room?
We've only been over this how many times?
Well, you're a tower of support.
He's directing now.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Scout's honor.
Just do what I say, alright?
Take your time, Jer.
Happy anniversary, baby.
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
What did you get me?
No.  Did you?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
I mean, you're really back.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
Dinner.  Don't be angry.
Not properly watered.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
She left the fucking gate open.
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
That is not true.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Don't do this.
Don't do this!
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
You're not ready.
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
I know.
Will you make love with me?
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
Ours.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Oh.  You're serious.
Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
Sally did all this herself?
A little out of my element.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
Elitism?
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
Ryan's really angry with me.
Medallions.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
That's very nice.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
How do you do, Skye?
I think there are sixteen there.
What?
I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan.  Utterly fantastic.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
Ready to go?
You're not serious.
God willing.
Excuse me?
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
And I'm overwhelmed.  And I want to do it justice.  And I hope we can spend time together.  And I'm gushing.  It's my worst quality.
Really??
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Panes is here!
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
It could be worse.
Fuck you, Panes.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
Like the last time.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
Shit!
You're a shit.
I never like to talk about my work.
Well, something's wrong.
You're my best friend.
Thank you, Panes.
You don't need to thank me.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
I didn't know you had this.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
Enough about me.
Like Joe.
In the guest room.  I've laid out a paint table for them.
Yes.
So where should I put it?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
Well good.  Thank God.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
General -- we have to talk sometime!
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
Divinely?
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
We're going to die!
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
Z!  what are you doing?
And do Princesses do improper things?
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
That's correct, sir!
Not that one.  Or that one.
Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  If you ask me, he's one giant bore.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
...Not enough food?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Wear this.
This the place?
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Ma'am?
What did I tell you?
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
I hope everything goes all right.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
You mean tonight?
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
You shouldn't.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Three.
No -- I like it.
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
Here. How about some breakfast?
Someone from the office.
In his apartment.
His apartment?
What's your friend's name?
When are you coming home?
Was he really upset when you told him?
No doubt about it.
Why not?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
I would.
There's a call for you --
For me?
Are you all right?
Are you supposed to?
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
A what?
Over a girl?
Here.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Fine. How's your eye?
How's everything at the apartment?
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
I never thought he'd do it.
I guess so.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
That's very wise.
I'm fine all over.
Last night?
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
Baxter?
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
The Vice Squad?
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
I'm not through with you yet.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
Sir?
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Don't mind what?
How's that again?
No key!
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
What do you want?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Oh.  'Bye, Doc.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
What's her name?
Just as long as she's okay.
Kubelik -- with two k's.
It's regulations.
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
Well, I have things to do --
Where are you moving to?
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
What for?
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
Six weeks. But who's counting?
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
I want you back, Fran.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Atlantic City?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
I told you -- with my mother.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Lovely. You were a big help.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
It won't happen again.
Yeah.
Well --
My men --
One for all -- all for one --
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
Moonby what?
Winning the war by yourself.
Which part is that ?
Yeah. Way north.
Let's talk about you.
Sometimes.
At least you always have enough water. How many gallons does each one of those damn things carry ?
It's really too much -- I mean I've collected every picture of her since she was Miss December.
Holy shit.
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
How?
What do you see?
I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us.
And the grass?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Get in there !
When'd you do it?
Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --
Listen.
Which way? Right or left?
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
What do you want ?
I only met Kurtz once.
Ours.
Spooky.
Charlie?
How did they know?
No, sir.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Where've you been riding, Lance?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
They far enough?
The wind --
What do you mean?
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. Walked.
What'd you do for supplies?
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
When did you hear?
Hairy ?
You'll find enough Cong up there.
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
Music?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
No -- no, sir.
What do you mean, Colonel?
What other reason could you have come? A Captain. Ranger. Paratrooper. Graduate of the Recondo School. Am I right about these things?
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
Yeah, I like it...
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
You can't have water after morphine.
How's the pain?
I can handle it.
What Truth?
No water.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
Fuck no.
What are you doing?
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
Sure.
And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
The other one --
That's me.
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
Why?
This boat's a mess.
So Kurtz is alive.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
I should be checking on the boat.
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What things?
I know.
So that's it.
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
215  CONTINUED:
Let's go.
165  CONTINUED:  
27   CONTINUED:
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
Had?
Oh.
How did she..?
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
Have you talked to Eric?
The radio's on the fritz.
Where'd you say Eric is?
Stay here.
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
Did you catch Corbett?
Was there any trouble?
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
-- Permanently?
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
You're hurt.
Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Had no choice...  ...Given the situation.
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Does he have people?
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Be my guest.
Have to backtrack, find another way down.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
Yeah?
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
How many do you see?
You don't feel cold?
Stay still.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
Don't bet on it.
I already have.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Snow's to their advantage, kid. You can't see them, but soon as that plane comes, they'll sure as hell know where we're going. Wise up.  Take me to the Yukon. I'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away.
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
Bet you're right.  But I didn't come by to wangle a meal --
What'd you say they call these spaceships?
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
There you go.  Wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' Bambi-lovers.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Look, we pull Ben's ass out of the fire, I'll get you a whole damn crate of Snickers bars.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Don't be silly. How bad?
He's good...  And I'm an expert on doctors.
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
I'm starving.
I've got Jews at my table.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
No.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
And?
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  Baked or fries?
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Never.
Sex with Simon?
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't.
Go ahead.
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
Yes. I really would.
Can you not be violent?
Why? What have you been thinking about?
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
One night with me!
No. No. Get Carol.
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
Help!
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
What?
Sorry. What are those cards?
Terrify me?
Absolutely.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
Oh, is he dead?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
Which color was that?
Do you realize that I work at him?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Rot in hell, Melvin.
Come on, sweetheart...
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I told you to go on in.
I think you gotta camp it here...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
What did she say?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
But you know where you're lucky?
I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
So you're practically finished, huh?
Why are you doing this?
What?
What restaurant?
Uh, Fontella's
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
Didn't you here all them sirens? It's been all over the radio.  Some guy shot Leevio Valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the Trattoria Roma.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
Probably.
What are you doing?
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
You can't --
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
How long have you been freelance?
Robert Bain, driving me!  Jesus fucking Christ!
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
Such language in front of a lady.
How in the fuck do you know that?
Who is the mark?
A player?
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Um, five.
Get on the expressway.
Nikita?  She helped me find you.
I work for the government.
Yeah.
Now what?
Nikita?
Another contractor.
Someone hired both of you?
Because he is trying to retire me.
He wants to kill you?
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yes.
Forget it!
Listen -- I don't even know your name.
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Electra.
Yeah.
Why?
With computers.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
He was... taken.
Where you wanted to be?
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Jesus -- why?
Why not?
You went from high school to the Agency?
Ahhhh...
Women?  No... not really.
Why not?
Why did you leave the Agency?
Tell me about the first time.
My first take?
Yes.
Why?
Are they usually like that?
They become complicated... messy.
That's fiction.
Where is it?
Thinking.
What?
Do you think about the game?
Yes.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Breakfast.
Taiwan.
Not that I would know, but you look like you're really good at it.
Thank you.
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
Check.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
That's right.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
We split the money?
For Nicholai?
Yes.
It wasn't planned or premeditated. I swear.  Things happened beyond my control.  I understood; I saw where they were leading and I suppose that it just made sense.
Yes.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
No.
They're worth less points.
Thank you.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
I'm sure you will.
Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
Did you --
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
Honestly?
I'm not normal.
What?
Shit.
Okay.
Electra --
Hi.  Did you call --
Then, I'll sail alone.
I think I've heard of you.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Taken.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Some.
Yeah.
How would you like the funds?
American currency.
This will take some time.
A coke, if they have it?
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
How to make a buck!
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Who's your friend?
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Well, don't get carried away.
No, why?
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
Don't we have enough already?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
I thought you were gonna throw these?
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Let's split.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Why don't we go together?
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
No, not yet.
No, We aren't going to do it.
I fell in love.
And a tram hit you?
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
She's cool.
A fine specimen for conversion.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
Tell me some bad news?
I don't want to ruin your day.
That bad?
He got that one right.
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
What happened?
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
And if you're wrong.
No!
Do you know the way?
It's that one isn't it.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
So am I.
Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Really?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
I don't want to get in trouble.
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
I thought for sure they would catch me.
If you get out can we be together again.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
I'll do my best. Is the place open.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
What pay-check? You ain't done nothing!
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
I figured you more as a Socialist?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
No, just a coffee.
I had it coming from someone.
Did you take your things over to my place?
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
And you broke into that room?
That's right.
Why did you break into that particular building?
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
And the students?
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
Josh!
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Come on Holly!
You bastard!
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Yes, if you can get him free.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
What are you an idiot!
So, who is in the building?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
She's coming over here...
And I have no idea why.
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
'Bout what?
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
You do. You're handsome and charming.
I meant he's a doctor.
Now it's okay?
Deranged.
I don't make small talk --
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
'They won't.'
I know you don't want help.
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
What's with the friggin numbers?
So what else is on this list?
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
The world of the dead?
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
You're really into God, right?
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
You have to believe to have faith.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Maybe you inspire me.
It's not.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
It's a start.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Is there a rush?
It's only 7:30.
Before we do this.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
Stand right here.
You planned this --
Can you locate XXI5639I?
I don't care.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
That what you do?
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
Why didn't you tell me?
Nope.
How you doing?
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
I'm asking how much.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
Does it have to do with Jamie?
Landon. You're not the quiet type.
How do you -- the two of you -- get by?
Materially or spiritually?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
For Jefferson High. For books.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
Thank you.
Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
This... is the number one single?
What's N.R.C.?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Then you'll be going to school here....?
What time does school start around here?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
But he didn't ask me.
What drill?
Fine..
Well... yeah...
What do I say?
Huh?
Okay. So right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me -
Maybe if I used my left....
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Sir, it only costs a nickel.
March 11th.
What?!
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
Marty, that would alter history.
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
Marty.
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
On second thought, there may be some things you'll have to tell me.
The power converter...
How did you know?
You answered the door!
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Well, it was there.
My guess is that she turned him down.
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
Perfect...
What year is this?
Dick? Dick who?
What did you do to your hair?
Well, he's gone.
Oh yeah?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
That's what he told you, huh?
I'll catch up with you.
Does he bite?
You lost that one?
Is that right?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Doing what?
Yeah.
Spanish.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
You know what I think?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
But it would hurt.
Why?
How you doing?
Think I got 'em?
What'd you put him in there for?
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Yes.
It's mine all right.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
What?
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Let her out. In my custody.
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
Did you say..."Peggy"?
He offered you money?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
Go away.  Let me rot?
You.  Like the papers all say.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
You don't wanna know.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Stay here, I'll be back.
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
What's his problem?
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Why me?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
I see.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
I want to know!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
...Who?
...Hello.
How long you been up there, Fink?
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
What's that?
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Wuddya got for me  what the hell happened to your face?
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Well I...
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
I don't understand-
To see pap.
I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
No, what did it say?
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
What do you mean, Barton?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that 
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
That's okay; actually I am just starting out in the movies  though I was pretty well established in New York, some renown there,
Hell, I could tell you some stories
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying  a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my uncle.
It's okay, it's okay.
I hope these are your shoes.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
You gotta believe me 
Hold on 
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Jesus... They can tell that...
...I just don't know what... to do
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on  just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
You'll be back?
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
...Those your only bags?
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Hey, that's Dr. Gardner, isn't it?
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
So -- how are things?
Yes.
Catherine Tramell.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
Who?
Sometimes I really hate you.
You did it for me.
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
What is this interest you've got in her?
What do you want, Nick?
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
What are you doing here?
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
About a year and a half.
Did you go home with him?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
Yes, you do.
What's your new book about?
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
You like playing games, don't you?
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
How exactly did you hear?
I like you.
Don't get too cocky.
Why not?
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
Aren't you going to thank me?
What's it about?
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
Why take the risk?
How's your shoulder?
You're in over your head.
About three months before I met you.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
You still think I kill people, don't you?
No thanks.
What are you researching?
I finished my book.
Did you ever tie him up?
You have the right to an attorney.
Yes I am.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
What kind of talk?
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
What are you doing here, Pop?
What's goin' down, son?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
You feeling better?
I'm not afraid of her.
I don't know.  I'm just not.
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
I'm going with you.
Were you with him last night?
What was the motive?
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Fuck you, Phil.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
On what basis?
Did you check all four years?
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Hey  it's the big A.M..
Not sure. How was yours?
Do you ever get sick of it?
The whole thing  painting.
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Ignorant art?
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Cool.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
I'm interested in showing Jean's work.
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Hey  Willie Mays.
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
You got a date already?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Famous people are usually pretty stupid. You're too smart. You'd get bored to death. You don't wanna be like John Henry  fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It's about integrity. Follow your heart.
Check you later, man.
You gonna carry that around all night?
I guess it was a long time ago.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
I guess you did.
Guess I just got sick of him.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
What who's saying?
... What's the matter?
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
I'm your family.
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
It's three thousand dollars!
What's your name, man?
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
You like your dad's paintings?
That's a beautiful name. French?
What? Wait a minute... talk to me.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
What? What do you want?
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
So shut up and keep painting..
What time is it?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
I didn't know.
I just don't think you're being fair.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
I suppose you feel better now, sir.
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Where's the fire?
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
Hanging on every word.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
I'm listed.
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
Nope, I told her everything.
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
What happened?
I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
Your blood, Max.
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those, Oswald.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
That's fine, Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. Like the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin.
Working late?  I'm touched.
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
And a very, very good one.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Joanna and I were in love in London. But when I realized our age difference was too extreme -
Uncle Alfred?
You have?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
Alfred, are you...?
Oxbridge Academy?
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Keep it.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
You'd be surprised.
Crimefighter's rule number two.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
Can he save her?
No beauty...
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
We gotta get those locks changed.
She knows who we are.
No sign of the snowman.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
You're not even listening to me.
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
I wouldn't bet on that.
What?
Well...um...her.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
She wants to kill you.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Impressive
No gun.  How disarming.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
Make yourself right at home.
You will distract the bat and bird while I prepare to freeze Gotham.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
How about dangerous curves?
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
...Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications. he cut the funding for our work -
Our work?
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Sorry to bother you, sir. I have some rather distressing news about Master Dick.
I'm afraid Master Dick has... gone traveling.
How are you feeling, young man?
What?
...A bat.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
What do maniacs always want?
Mystery.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
How ya doin', Al?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
Up here, Al.
Why's that?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
I haven't had much luck with women...
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Wait. I have a riddle for you.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Mr...?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
No grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. But we make due. To your charms.  Skol.
La'chiem.
My opinion. This letter writer is a total wacko.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
But I'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
But...
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Oh God, Bruce. You're still jealous.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
What?
Excuse me.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
Absolutely not.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Who is it?
Hell. Might even bring old Stickley here a few extra bucks. Huh, Fred?
_We_ sure are.
I got family. ...Please.
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
Go ahead. You can say it.
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
Where's the boy?
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously.
What about the girl?
How much do you weigh?
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
Do you want a drink?
I don't... seek publicity -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while?
Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops.  Look, I bore myself silly.  Let's talk about you. How the hell did you wind up in Corto Maltese?
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
I don't sing very well.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
Finding out where she is.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!
WHAT?
What are you talking about?
What are you, scared of heights?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
Joker here. Can we talk?
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
Where does one man get all this junk?
Yep.  He watched the whole thing happen - - Recognize the beat cop?  Jim Gordon
Yeah. Deja vu.
HOLY SHIT!!
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
There aren't hotels?
Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
Meaning?
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
Right first time.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
We'll be able to start this afternoon.  I'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  Now, that'll impress the Governor.
This is Elmer, our longest serving...
Say that again, son.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
No!
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Ahm....
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
... in the distant future.
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Shut up, Kevin.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay us. We can buy a new TV.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
And Boot-Head.
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
Me first.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Uh... Is this the right bus?
Uh...
I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
Uh... bye-bye.
Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever gonna score?
Shut up, dill-hole.
Turd-burglar...
Butt-snatch...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Really? I poop too much.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
They perk me right up.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
Does that say Xanax?
Talk ta me, Bork.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
I see it. I don't get it.
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
Cavity search...?
That's better. Yes?
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black, about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name, dear?
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Who sent ya?
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
You'll be rich!
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
What?
That's how long you were gone.
Anything happen while I was away?
De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it came from.
I don't think we survived the crash.
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
<u>You</u> left me.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Of course I did.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
<u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whorehouse?  Have you ever been to...?
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You never got an A in science in your life!
Nobody else can.
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
What is going on?
Wait for who?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
We tried.
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
Just one daughter.
You're not gross.  Why were you wearing a sheet?
Tell the truth.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
No, Lydia, we're dead.
I want to be dead too.
How'd you do on the science test?
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Where'd they go?
Just <u>say</u> it.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
... I will.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Otho?
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
What?
... sheets.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer New York.  I'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  And when Otho and I get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Lydia, I will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  You help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
What's wrong?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Are they still here, Otho?
What's happening to them?
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Is this the key to the attic?
Hellooo!  How's school?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
... Straight out?
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
... Were you going somewhere?
No, Robert.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
... But he's...?
... Do you think we should look for him?
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
I hope you're comfortable.
I would like to watch television.
My name is Chance.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
No. It won't do that.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Chauncey!
Fine. He's very nice.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
No, thank you.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
Do you like it?
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
I agree.
Ben is very ill.
Yes, I understand.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Yes, it is very good!
Yes. I like that name very much.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
I understand.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Yes. I like to watch very much.
I can't read.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
Good day, Mr. Chance.
I agree.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
... Evening, Chance.
I see.
... I see.
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
Yes.
You're welcome.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
Since you were a child?
No.
How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
Compensated...?
How were you paid?
No, I do not have any of those.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Yes. It has.
... Nothing.
Try again.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
It's that gardener!
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
This is not what I requested.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
Who am I thinking of?
Morning.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
What?
Which one is Elijah again?
Is the trial date set?
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
Right.
Yeah. You want a beer?
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
How was it?
Why?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
What's that?
We?
Suck my dick!
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
It's Elijah.
The iguana?
A better friend.
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
I know.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
Holy shit, yes!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Pardon?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
My name is Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Yes?
I said "yes."
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
No, really.
Yeah.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Why not?
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
I'm right?
Somebody told you.
You married?
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Lotte? Is that you?
Hello. Wendy.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
Hi. Wendy! What're you up to in this vacant office.
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
What kind of circumstances?
The Great Mantini?
I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can handle it.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Think, Jew florist?
Says me. Do you dream often?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
Why not? I need to get in there!
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
When?
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Broadway's finest three hours. It's about the suppression of the individual. Conformity as God in modern society.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Great then.
Thanks so much for coming over.
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Come on in.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Sleepy suddenly.
Bad dream, darling?
I've got to leave Malkovich.
I see. Well, it is not my fault that thou art tiny. So if it is charity yer after, then be gone with ye, ye foul demon.
I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart.
Then what do I do?
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You getting into bed to think about yellow?
No. Sorry.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
YOU HURT ME.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
WILL YOU STAY?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Baby, don't be like that.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Well, is it now? How you getting along?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
Yes?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
You grown.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Yes?
May I come in?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Yes ma'am.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
I miss her.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
They good whitefolks?
I want to work, Miss Lady.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Back stiff?
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
She likes this dress...
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
He's sleeping in the church.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
He ask, I give him anything.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
Sethe. He took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to-
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
He knew Baby Suggs?
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Just me.
You planning to do anything about it?
I don't believe that. I won't.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Sethe?
You got to get up from here, girl.
I'm tired, Paul. So tired. I have to rest a while.
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
What do you think?
Why me, man?
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Uh-huh.
Her life is in your hands.
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
The Gundersons.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.
They range up to three thousand.
Fuckin' A.
Yeah.
What tied the room together, Dude?
If what's during league play?
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
What the fuck is he talking about?
Burkhalter.
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas.
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
No--
What have you.  We'll, uh--
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Lebowski on the right?
He's handicapped, huh?
Wonderful woman.  We were very--
Are these.
No, they--
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Yes, heh--
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, coloration.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Take it easy, Dude.
Howdy do, Dude.
What's your drink, Dude?
Which one was Logjammin'?
Of course, you do get the good with the bad.  The new technology permits us to do exciting things with interactive erotic software.  Wave of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.
I thought you might know, man.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
I was talking about my rug.
You mean coitus?
Oh, no.
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
That's really thoughtful but I--
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
Donny!  Please!
Huh?
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
What if it's during a game?
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Have it your way.  The point is--
The fucking point is--
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies--
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
What the fuck?
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
"Our" car, Walter?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
That wasn't her toe.
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
But Walter--
Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant!
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Yeah.
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
The bulk of the series.
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
It is a fucking emergency.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
Yeah?
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Yeah, and you were--
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
This driveway.
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Walter, you fuck!
Yeah.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
Then what's...
Wha. . . Donny--
Well can we--
Dude, I'm sorry--
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?
Yeah.
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Are you employed, sir?
Is this a--what day is this?
But I do work, so if you don't mind--
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Who the hell is he?
Walter--
You come all the way down here to roust--
We'll take 'em in the morning.
Where to first?
What is it with you people and pain?
What was that?
Like cancer with a purpose.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
It means "bloodbrother."
How do you feel?
You came back for me.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Your security's for shit, kid.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
He was here.  Watching us.
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Tell me something, Skid --
Scud.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Get in. Youre leaving.
Whistler, I --
How can you be out here?
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You're wrong.
Pass.
Is something wrong, my friend?
You're blind --
I am tired. Dawn is coming.
But I just got here --
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
You used me as bait?!
How can you tell?
Like what?
It's dark in here.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
You don't look so good.
I've been better --
How long have we been driving?
Is it bad?
It won't work on you.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
LaMagra --
You.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic.
Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin.
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
--or incredibly fucking naive.
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
Bullshit! Talk!
Domini?
What're you doing there?
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Something was wrong.
No!
Mrs. Leavitt--
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
Oak?
Yeah, so?
This is funny?? This is tens of thousands of fucking dollars!  You pricks! I'll see you in fucking court!!
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Looks like business is booming.
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
So says her website.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
You sure?
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
Your body, your call.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
I don't know. Nightmare.
I can't.
Are you marked like this??
I know, I know.
<u>One</u> set. Everything from midnight on--
How'd you know they were--
I don't know yet.
This is a little nuts.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
--go!
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
What about night?
Mi casa y su casa!
English.
Where <u>is</u> it?
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
Boy Kurth.
What the fuck--??
For "James?"
What?
I'm not finished.
Was it <u>every</u> day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
<u>What</u>?
403 41st Street, kids: home.
Running a junk yard.
--whatever you want, no problem--
How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
--sacred and occult Scotch Tape.
Ah, Domini?
Pointless.
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
What's that?
He'll never know.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Still working on it.
You gonna be alright?
Get some more beer.
I think you closed the bar again. I'll have to go out.
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Domini.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
Why?
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
--yes--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
Yes.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
See a guy.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
...Huh?
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
...You ever get tired?
...You all right?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...What?
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Ray--
...That's what's important.
...Who?
Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line?
I own the place.
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
...What're you gonna do in Houston?
I told you. I like you.
See, I never knew that.
Well now you do.
Back where?
Sign.
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine--
What did you take these for?
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
What do you think?
Ya catch any fish?
...Count it if you want.
Has Ray come in yet?
What.
That's not the point.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Got a problem, Meurice?
Tuesday.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Frank. Come in.
To your health, Frank.
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
It must be great.
Yes?
Why do you do it?
What color is it?
Okay?
Who knows you have these?
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
. mommy's here.
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
Those are my breasts.
Bull.
Nobody.
Do you like talk like that?
Sure I'm alright. 
Do you like me?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Nice guy.  Who's he?
Who is Don?
Don?. Are you in with them?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Yes.
Do you like my body?
Are you a bad boy?
Does that scare you?
Come on Dorothy.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Yes.
I want you to stay with me.
What?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Go where?
On a ride.
Heineken.
Here's to Ben.
Hey? . You like to walk.
Yes.
There ya go.
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
I don't know.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
What's the plan.
Yeah. but.
Okay. yeah, call.
Okay. thanks.
He got a little jealous.
You want a Dairy Queen?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
Yes.
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
That's what I thought.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
I'm really sorry.
What am I going to do?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
It's okay.
You want to dance?
Really?
NO.
No.
Dorothy! ... Dorothy!
Good to see you, son.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
I mean, for good, Jeffrey.
Well. Okay.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Nothing. I'm fine.
Hello. uh. my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Sandy? ...Sandy, please.
What are watchin' this junk for?
You can change it if you want to.
I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
He what?
Que va hacer?
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Honey, your nose!
You wanna split?
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Excuse me?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
Excuse me?
Mirtha.
What can I do for you guys?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
What the fuck is that?
We want some grass.
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
And I only deal with you?
Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited me.
Yeah.  She told me.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
You?
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
Twenty-six months.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Good night.
Because they caught me?
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Please, continue.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
George.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
We're half a million off.
Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.
There's no room.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Derek Foreal.
No more brothers, Diego.
Cocaine?  How much?
Today.
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Layaway shmayaway.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Un sapo?
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Yeah, maybe.
Beautiful girls?
Money.
And Diego?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
What are you going to do?
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Just low.
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?
Figured it out.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
I don't know.  My name is George.
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.
Pablo said no?
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
But this is...
Where are you going?
Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight. I'll do something.
Not in front of the kid.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love her, y'know?  I kind of want to have her.  I've been away for so long.  Make up for the missed time, you know?
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Yeah.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
Well, here I am.  See?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
Shhhh.
But I have a visitor.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Yes, I do.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone just got a raise.  Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
Very nice.  I'll take it.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
Yeah?
Are we good?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
I understand. What's your question?
You afraid of these ...?
It's true.
What ... What must I decide?
But I haven't shot him.
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
Read it.
Where's Kader?
To show them to the UN, right?
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
Why?
Are you ready, colonel?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing.  Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
What'd he die of?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
Is this the bottle that was found on the nightstand?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Sex.
Aren't they all?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs Crawford's educational background has to do with this case.
That's ridiculous.
Objection!
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney that the person on trial here is Miss Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
I have.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Rebecca Lawson.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Six years.
No -- never.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Is it Marsh?
About a year and half ago.
I had bypass surgery.
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for you, but it's important you tell the court what she did.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
What kind of information?
Did you suggest any?
-- And what did you suggest?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
Yes.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
You'll be sorry?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
Then -- those are not your own words?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
What happened next?
What changed?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
He video taped you.
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
No.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
Three fifteen.
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
No.
What do you have in your purse?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
Yes.
Are you going to represent me?
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
Frank!
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
No pain, no gain?
I thought the subject was sex?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
-- And then?
Can we get out of here?
Is it against the law?
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Nothing.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
What would?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
She's mistaken.
Alone?
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
You don't need anybody.
I'm dropping the case.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
That wasn't the deal.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
Alright, I'll talk to her
What are they saying?
Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
Michael -- get off the phone.
Why?
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
Mr. Dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the District Attorney's Office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true -- you better have more than a hunch.  Do you?
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
Really?
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
I don't know.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
What time did you leave?
No -- never.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
How bizarre!
Well, there's a problem.
Yeah.
Michael.
What?!
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
'82.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Grateful!?
Well, I'd like to read them.
No. We're going to lock this up and --
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
You want me to call the doctor?
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
No.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
Oh, that's nice.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
Much.
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
She starts sniffing me.
You sound like an artist.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
Why did you stop?
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
I'm sorry. That was...
You drink bug repellent?
What?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
No. I was just... No.
Oh.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
How about if I set the table?
What?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes.
Have you ever been to that station?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Why?
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Near the church.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
Where was she?
Am I too heavy for you?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Yeah. It could get better.
No. Don't do this.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
You feeling better Franny?
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
'Bout 4:30.
Where you going?
Franny?
Betty.
What's she like?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Is it true?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.  This is too much.
What the hell you talking about?
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
You got a nice crib here.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
I want you to do something for me, baby.
Where are we, baby?
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't you?
You know I can't.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
All the more reason I should be here.
Who?
Are they on the radio?
How do you know?
Careful.  That's bad luck.
That place is already bad luck.
Why?
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
The dead get out?
Cinn?
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
Bill!  Bill?!
Let me see it.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
Shit, that was fast.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
You boys been hitting the pipe?
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
You haven't?
Why not?  He eats everything else.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
That building?
I was born near here.  But after my mother died, my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
You shouldn't have hit me.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
Where is this going, Johnnie?
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
All right!  Where's the key?
Caesar!
Sit down, Gino!
Jesus, Caesar!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Caesar, what happened?
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
But you know he did it.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Caesar, this is crazy.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Caesar ...
...  maybe three hours.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Where, then?
Caesar, don't.
You're helping Rajeev?
I should be going.
You can't kill me yet.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
Cease, can I ask you something?
Actually, yeah, she was nervous about Gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  You know women, Mick.
You got the key?
Call me as soon as you get him.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
A favor?
Truck.  Of course.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
No, but Caesar does.  He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
Caesar is your husband?
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Okay, one drink.
Why?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
The redistribution of wealth?
You didn't want to see me, did you?
We're not that different, Corky.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
What you heard wasn't sex.
You mean Shelly?
Yes.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
Do you think you know me like that?
He hung it up.
What?
It's in a case, on his desk.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
What happened?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
I was so afraid you ...
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Hey.
Pop?
Done.  We go now.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.
Caesar wants me to stay.
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
I know you will.
Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
Yes.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
I think so.
Are you Treadstone?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
We have to go home, Jason.
Keep it. 
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Look, maybe I should just...
...yes -- oui -- uh...

You are a friend of his?
Yes.
Who?  Who came?
His brother.  You know his brother?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I need a ride.

Oh, Jesus... 
Get the fuck away from my car.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Jesus...
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I don't know.
Listen to what you want.
That's what I'm saying.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Where are we?
So this is it, right?
I don't remember any of this.
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
He came to kill us.
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
-- we'll explain it --
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
I don't know.

What was I thinking, right?
I can't protect you anymore.
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
What the hell're you talking about?
Wait a minute --
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
That's the only angle.
Sir...
What's that?
Tell him we're busy.
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What the fuck is he doing?
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
You drink rum?
Machines don't fix themselves.
I think we'd better have a look.
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
...Yer nostril?
...ven't you?
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
... yer ducts.
... new washer.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
In fact, killing people -
Do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
Thanks very much Sam.
If I can help you ...
Sam, what are we going to do with you? Can you hear me, Sam?
Sam!
Jack!
You are late.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
Ah ...
What?
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
How do you mean?
Not much.
Christ! You do know it all!
Yes. I'm impressed.
Why?
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Take her off the list.
We don't make mistakes.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Jack, she's innocent!
Jack, I'm innocent! Help me.
You stupid bastard!
How could you do this to me?
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Where do I get it stamped?
Who are you? Let go!
No.
Don't litter my cab!
It's my fucking life.
Why not?
Where are you taking me?
What?
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
What's going on here?
OK. What's in the parcel?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Every day?
You're joking.
I thought you arrested me.
I was right! Step on it!
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
We? Don't blame me!
Are you still following me?
Don't do anything silly.
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Oh, good!
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Try next of kin.
Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
Can I forget it?
Damn! Blast!
What's the matter?
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I did it for you.
What! Shit!
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
This is your dream girl, is it?
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise. 
I just wish you would stop interfering, mother! I don't want promotion. I'm happy where I am.
Mr Helpmann was very close to your poor father. He was very close to me. Still is. He'll take you under his wing at Information Retrieval. You'll like it when you get there.
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
What have you done with his body?
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
I can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. What do you recommend, Spiro?
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
But I could be anybody.
what? ... Oh ... 
What the - ? How did you - ?
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Ha!!
The pace?
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
She's having a baby. Twins.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
Does that hurt?
You're going to live.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
He's going to be all right, right?
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
No, I'd better not.
At least he's got people around him.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
Yes.
Did you see my father?
No.
Yes?
I think it looks good.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
He's better, though, right?
You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
You married?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
How long you been doing this?
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him?  That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
This is not a good time.
The ghosts--
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
What do you want to break?
He's crazy. He can't help it.
What?
I'm not hungry.
They'll just keep calling.
Faster! God!
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
What did I do to you?
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Keep it to yourself.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
Shut up a second...
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
And the rule was...
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
Wait.
I don't like being handled.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
Oh, God, no!
Hold it down, okay?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
Yes.
Eventually rising to...
Okay.  Let's do me.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
I didn't know you were going with him.
Did you bring your grey suit?
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.
Then it went well.
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.
No.
Then what was good about it?
I lost six pounds...
Aaron, will you tell me?
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again.  Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
People phoned in.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
Aaach...Jane...  Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me.  Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you.  You know?
This isn't friendship.
How?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Speaking.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
I saw the smile -- good piece.
Stop it.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Outside?
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Do it then.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.
Just a few questions?
Move away from me.
What is she shooting?
I was a little nervous there for a minute.
Goodbye, Paul.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
What did he say?
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Follow me.
I really have to go.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
...good-bye then.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
Go ahead.
No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
I trust you.
Hey?
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Billion.
Nervous?
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
I'll wait for you till seven.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Uh-huh.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway.  I should get some sleep.
Yes.
Good night??!
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
That's yes?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
Where's the bathroom?
That's enough.  That's enough.
I'm sorry.
Uh-huh.
If you were an artist you could have created something!
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Alright we're clear.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
What did he do?
You really like it?
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
You think she's better than Murdered Man?
May I please have another little kiss?
Did you hear what he said?
Yes Walter.
Nice night out...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Forget it.
It was.
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
What's the matter with you?
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
There's that weird dude again.
What did he say?
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
You...made that?
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
Go home.
H-have a seat?
I thought I'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
You didn't mean to what?
You better hold off on the bubbly.
What do you have in the box?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
How ya doin'?
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
Telling you what?
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
Walter shut up and relax!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Well I'm overjoyed.
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
Hi.
T-turned on?
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Well, I'll go home with you.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
Uh, no, I didn't see him at all.
Good night Walter...
What's all the noise in here!
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.
Suck!
No, we didn't.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
You're the guys from the movie!
Rich bitches.  They're a plague. They've gotta be stopped.
Get away from here.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Yeah, I guess.
Well... it's possible they think my name's Bobby.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.
What'd you dream about?
Hey there.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
I thought we were meeting here.
No, you didn't.  When?
You weren't home.  Like always.
You left me a message?
You want some water or something?
Well, stay here tonight.
You sure?
Who?
A dress.
Dress, huh?  What for?
What for?
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I'm glad you came.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Beverly Center.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
Yeah, whoops I came.
Am I in trouble or something?
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
I was a slave.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
All right.  What do we do now?
I have cheerleading squad.
Why do you keep saying that?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, him.
We'll cover it later.
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
Good Lord.  What do you study in history?
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
There isn't time.
Football is my life.
Wait!
Come one, that was so weird.
I don't get it.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Pike.
I haven't seen him tonight.
What... are you?
I can't!
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Hi, Grueller.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
You think so?
Got that.
Write that down.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Cool!
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Oh, yeah!
I really was way way too too.
You know, just because you're having full-on wiggans doesn't mean you have to drag us into it.  This isn't just any dance.  It happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
I don't think so.
I am.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
You said "Crash".
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
How 'bout a back rub?
That's my leg.
Fundamentals?
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
You don't have to...
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Well I guess this is it.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
You should be at the game.
Oh my...  Don't leave...
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
You're pulling your hips out.
Damn.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
Crash...I want you.
Aren't we all?
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
I doubt that.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
What's so great about baseball?
I don't know if I'd go that far.
Why not?
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Annie---
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
What's it say?
He's a good student.
Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
What's that?
You spit on me!
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
How come you don't like me?
What do I got?
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Party without me.
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
I'm trying to thank you.
Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
Step outside, pal.
No way.
I gotta go now, Dad.
I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
Well tell 'em, honey.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
It's a league record.
We're eight and sixteen.
It's a miracle.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
What the hell's going on out there?
It's a damn convention.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--
What?
...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.
You were never my guest?!
Was I at that dinner?
A powerful man.
...been right, but who knows?
Stop -
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Hello.
She's not here, Sam.
Lester...
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.
You mean, I have your permission?
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.'
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Hello.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Yeah.
All right.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
...on the line and this guy's out havin' the time of his life. He has every cop in the state watchin' him, and he's out playin' golf.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
What are you -
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
Back -
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
Hello.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
You go and put your things away.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Hello.
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
Half of everything is mine.
Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
...and she doesn't always -
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
We need this guy.
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
Nice to see you, Senator.
Now, he's really pissed.
Who's this?
I-I'll do it.
I'll be right back.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
You all right?
Why're you crying?
It's chinchilla.
It's nice isn't it?
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.
But as much as they loved her...
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Yeah.
What are you talkin' a- ?
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
Huh?
I didn't take your pills.
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
Hello.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
Right.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
Pretty serious.
It's under...
And...
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Mm-hm.
Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand?
Get off of me! Stop it!
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
You're not takin' Amy.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
I threw it away.
So, who'd you go to lunch with?
To the Riviera.
She had the same.
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
I was with somebody.
What if he won't stop?
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
You understand? What? Let you go?
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
I want you to let me go.
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Not gonna let me in?
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
...and hypocrisy.
Loose machines are right back over there.
Well...
Yeah, okay.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
I really think you're -
...worst possible time for me.
So, you're a righty?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Mm.
...I got muscled on the street.
Yeah.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
I don't want to go to Europe.
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
What expenses?
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
Yes.
Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Sam?
Can I go in?
And here. Here.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.
Hey!
Come on. I'm sorry.
Here we go!
We're waiting on Carmine.
Carmine left?
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
How are you?
It's in all the papers.
What're you gonna do?
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
He's good. He's fine.
Mm.
Uh-huh. Good.
Tell me.
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.
Sure.
I can see that. Sure.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Okay.
Yes, you did.
Sure did.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
Great.
...same outfit.
Yes!
What's the matter?
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Get lost?
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
Do you know that?
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
We'll go later.
He called you right here.
I just talked to him.
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
...they're in Penthouse K.
They checked in alone.
Are they out now?
Boy, look at this place, huh?
Ace saw Vegas one way.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
It's up to you.
They're havin' a good time too.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
You must have drunk too much.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Take it easy!
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
Fuck you!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Hey.
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Denying?
Do I hear a motion seconded?
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
I know it, I know it.
Take it easy, though.
All right, all right. But I - I -
Yes, uh...
The crowd bought it.
Works for me.
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
You know, nobody likes you...
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
Selina, are you okay?
You're kidding.
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
God, can you hear me!
Catwomen. Lots of them!
What do you want from me?
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
What's the catch?
What a "drag."
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
What did you say?
Well, we spent enough time building the damn thing, might as well use it.
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman, as long as I'm a good warrior.
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
Hello, Spooky.
For when the time comes..
For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
I'm a good mother!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Stop.
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
Yeah, she's okay.
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
But of course you are.
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Did you try to kill...
What?
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
You are...
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
It's seeing-eye dogs, ma'am. If I let the cat stay, will you go out with me?
Maybe.
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
You seem sad, Spooky.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
What was that for?
You could've made me lose my call.
Say something ...
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
You gotta just look the other way.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
What's this?
I told you I should've cuffed him.
He's seen both of us now.
You switched license plates?
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Make a "U" and go back.
Got your badge?
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Nels?
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
Lady, try making some sense.
They're holding my husband downstairs.
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
What about the others?
Tell me what she looks like.
Sometimes I paint.
Our house always needs touching up.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
That makes two of us.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
I can hear you again, clearly.
The one in Brentwood.
Even if you found us -- what then?
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Don't say that.
Do you know what's in that box?
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
It won't be him.
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Did you hear that click?
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Lucky for them they didn't.
Are you okay?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Yes sir.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
It's locked.
At least one.
Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Stop talking like that!
He wants 75 back.
What's happening?
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
Think you could do a picture of me?
Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
I don't want it.
Who is this?
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Didn't we play this scene before?
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Pass.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
308-9962.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
Just relax.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
We're waiting on you.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Negative.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
Are you trying to panic the women?
Stop the crying.
Don't worry.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
There's two police cars now.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Yeah?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
In your dreams.
Who were you talking to?
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Undercover.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
It takes all types.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
See what, Dil?
Yeah?
Maybe he wants something.
Ask him.
He's back, Col
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
Stop it, Dil --
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off back to Essex!
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
Two hundred quid, Mr. Deveroux.
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
In a way.
Guy I work with.
No.
Scottish?
Yes, thank you.
What was that all about?
He wants me to perform for him.
Where?
Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
How special?
Piss off, Dave!
What'll it be?
What would he think?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Did he come here too?
Maybe.
Why?
Dil --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
Got your note. So let's kiss and make up, hon.
Don't call me that.
Sorry, darling.
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
You could?
I said stop it.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Probably.
You can always pretend.
There's Dave. He knew too.
Am I becoming repetitious?
Don't be cruel.
Happy now?
Not at all, honey.
You gonna tell me why?
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
What's her?
She from Scotland too?
Anything.
You'd do anything for me?
Why?
Yes.
And you wouldn't leave me?
You promise?
You're no good at this, Jimmy.
What?
I was trying to get out of something.
You mean that?
Prescription. For my condition.
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
More endearments.
Whatever you say, Dil.
What would you do for me?
Dil!!!
Yes. Now.
Not if you go.
The Metro.
Sorry, love. Now, the white ones are magnesium supplement --
Thirty-five.
Please, Dil --
So what do you need, Fergus?
Need to go across the water.
Do you now.
Have a look at him.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Yes.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
And what if I say no?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Dil!
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Why would you do that?
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
Back in a minute, Jody
And do you know why?
I'm sure.
Who'd you think it was?
And who's Dave when he's at home?
He's at home.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
What do you mean you can't?
Am I?
Thank you, handsome.
How did you know it was her?
Hey --
What do you know about my nature?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
Why not?
Absolutely not.
Don't I know it.
I got sent.
Shouldn't take it personally.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
And you play cricket?.
Best game in the world.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Can't.
Shut up, would you?
Fergus?
Yeah?
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Having a pint in the Rock.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
Do you?
I've often wondered how you do it.
It's as simple as that?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
I don't know her.
Don't.
How can I?
Go to sleep now.
A story.
When I was a child...
Yeah?
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Nothing.
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
You stupid bastard --
I said you bastard -- stop --
Hurling --
Don't run off, Jude.
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
It was fun while it lasted.
All right -- where's the letter?
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
I could eat a horse.
Oh!
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Oh, you should see your face.
What's the matter?
Adam!
Why do you think I brought you here?
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
When you come on, you really come on.
You're going to look for him -- now?
What is it?
Where's that airlines bag?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Yes, you told me.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Now what?
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
Reggie -- listen to me!
You lied to me so many times --
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
I said, tell me to go to the --
Then say it.
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
But I don't have it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Were you followed?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Describe him.
Barely, yes.
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
It's Charles!
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
No.
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
-- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
Do I knock or something?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Scobie?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Alexander.
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
There, you said it.
Okay.
Who told you to do that?
They've got Jean-Louis!
What day is it?
Maybe.
What's so illogical about that?
Who?
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
Got you.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
What are you doing?
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
The money is unimportant.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
What's its value today?
And the last one?
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
Mrs. Lampert --
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Tell me what?
I don't know anything.
Leave me alone -- !
Yes.
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
He was American?
Swiss.
Is it all right?
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elyses"  Why there?
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
Did you?
I don't understand.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
I'm Regina Lampert.
Good for you.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Oh. I guess.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Are you in the book?
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
Do you know what you're going to do?
We'll find you a hotel.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
On the street where you live.
How would you like a spanking?
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Be careful, Peter.
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
What?
So they think he left it with you.
Yes -- that's right.
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Miz Lampert, ma'am...
No -- no, I'm don't.
But what?
Because I don't love him.
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
What?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
You do?
What I don't understand is why they asked Marliston if Rod was a virgin. They could have asked you Cindy.
I think it's funny.
You want me to die? I thought you and I were tight.
Not my imports.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
So?
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
That's impossible.
Daddy you scared me!
Hi honey.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
A little.
I thought you'd be pleased.
It can't be.
Who is she Daddy?
Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
No!
As bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
Should we close down any eruption?
What happened?
You know where I can find her?
Can you get inside?
We just found another body.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
You fucked me up!
I'm sure you should have failed.
Of course I'm scared.
Then you should go.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Really?
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Mark Shale.
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Oh nice save.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
Not that many.
Stag?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Cut it out.
Are you O.K.?
I'm fine.
I heard you got attacked.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Are you coming to the party?
My dad's down there!
Lisa Sherman?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
Years ago, something horrible happened in this town. When I was still in high school. A girl named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
And the police did nothing?
The word is Mob.
Who?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
What?
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
Ok.
Hide your laptop here.
I said no.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
If sheep don't count.
Okay, okay.

Damn.

...that is going to explode...
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.
Since when does...
...moron.
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
Huh?
Sorry, man.  He's dead.
I need your truck.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
For cryin' out loud.
No.
Would you hurry up, please?
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
Come on, get in the truck.
What the hell's goin' on?
We're clear.
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
Ah, one of them's in the back.

Doesn't work.
What?
...-ed.

Okay.
 No...
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...you.
...I believe in live and...
...let live.
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Fuck! 
Oh, shit.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!

...do we?
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!
...Night Shift, but you might...
...wanna give it a try!
Come on.
I made it!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Holy--!
 Gee, you think so?
Shut up!


 Shit. 
Come on.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
These'll keep it cold.
Yeah...
 Listen!  Listen...
...to him!  You don't know who...
I'm a dangerous man!
Taking it down the hill.
Oh, shit!

...did you?
...stole the truck.
...piece of shit was worth.
It won't even start half the time.
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...
So you took his...
So I took his truck, yeah.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
We were nationally  ranked.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
Listen, Arlo...
Not completely, anyway.
I mean, if that gun was...

Hey.   Mason.
I think you oughta cut a...
...or my conscience.
...man.

Arlo, shut up.

What?
We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
 Okay.


Okay. 
Okay. 
Arlo!
Go, go, go! 
 That's why I didn't give it...
...-ful?!
Here...
And Brynner's right on...
...our ass!
...here comes the...
...tunnel!
What?


...-ta get outta here!
Let's go!
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.


Who drove the ice cream...
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
Hello.
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...us.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
 big balls.
Hey.
We're worried...
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
...without compunction.


But...

Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
So you called the damned thing Elvis
You-You can't let him...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
...-lem too?
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
What?  Say again...
 ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...

Whoo-hoo! 
They were all wearing hardware.
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
You have my word on that.

...about--
You look fit...healthy...
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
...that.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
So far, ye-yes.
Pleasant surprise.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  He'll be more useful now.

Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
...-ther orders?
I wanna patch in from...
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
We were called in by the Jerome base...
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
...-ty.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...deer.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...Long.

...should be right outside.
Yeah?
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...the river.
...-tainer!

No.
 ...checked. 

Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
Yeah?
And don't give him any ice cream...
Ah.
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue.  But if it wasn't for you, I think he'd have drifted right on through this town.
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene.
Video lock.
Kabula's out.
No sign of 'em...
Forty-nine?
Major, we've gotta seal that tunnel!  Major!
Great.  All right...
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
...colonel?
Who's your suspect?
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
...-time. 
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  We use the same equipment, more or less...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...is a perfect hunter.
There's only one way you can do it, Mason.
...without caution...
Mason.
Call an ambulance.
 ...or it'll ignite. 
You're the only one I can trust.
 The only one who understands what this me-...
...-m-means, Mason.  
And only then does our noble friend realize...

Well, your prediction was on the nose.
I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony!
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
Do you recognize this young man?
Got that?
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  We've got your whole record.  We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
I didn't sell the boy any...
...beer.
Let me see your...
I said let me see your hands now!
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
...on the other end of this phone.
 Wait.  Listen to me, Pappas.  If you don't let us by...
 
The usual.  Doc.
Get in 


Gimme this god-...
It's too late, Mason. I've...
Look at that.
That's right.
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Lou Escobar  he's a Lieutenant.
Do you know him?
Where from?
Honest?
Why is that funny?
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
His girlfriend?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
How did you find out?
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Where is she?
What does this mean?
Hollie was always fond of tide-pools. You know what he used to say about them?
There's going to be some irate citizens when they find out they're paying for water they're not getting.
How do you do that?
Oh, my, yes.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
They don't kill a guy for that.
...No...
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Sure thing.
Where's that?
How much do you owe me, Curly?
I don't know...
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Well you own a lot of land.
Where did you get this material?
The apple core club.
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
How do they do that?
I have a cold I can't seem to shake but other than that, I'm fine.
Thanks, Lou.
You've done well by yourself.
Congratulations.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Or her name?
No, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. But they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb Mexicans living by a dam. Now beat it, Gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
Absolutely.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
Too late for what?
Matter of fact I do.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Yes.
But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
My husband's at the office.
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
What do you mean?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Well, how much would you like?
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
And you weren't the slightest bit upset about it?
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
I can't tell you.
That your maiden name?
How did it happen?
Over the water department, or over you?
Never forgave him for what?
You sure shout that?
No.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Why?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
I gave everybody the night off.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
It was in Chinatown.
Your eye.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
I know.
What did he say?  What did he say?
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
She's too upset.
Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Going somewhere?
No...
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
I said the truth!
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
Let me handle that.
Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
Sophie.
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
Oh yes we have... are you alone, Mr. Gittes?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Oh no.
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
The obituary column?
I'm sorry. We don't.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Only when you breathe... don't tell me you're still working for Mrs. Mulwray?
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
I said, the northwest valley.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Do you know me?
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
Si.
When it comes.
Gittes?... Gittes?
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
I'm afraid so.
But...
All right, what's your husband's first name?
No problem with me on the Job.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Apple core?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
So he says you sent them?
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
I'm going to see a man called Julian Cross. Ever heard of him?
Well, you never know, do you?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
So I can have these? 
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
Will they really find work in Germany?
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
You weren't expecting me?
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of all times!
But Alfredo, what you're saying is horrifying!
Who?
Sure, sure! Boccia...  What's he do?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
I don't remember him any moreMa, where's Russia?
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
So what's that got to do with it?
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
Who else did you see?
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Wasted?
Sixty-two thousand -
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
Mr. Bernstein, I wish you'd let me ask you a few questions, and answer me truthfully.
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
How do you do, Mr. Leland?
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Was the show covered by every department?
Yes - Mr. Kane.
No, Mr. Kane.
That's Leland, isn't it?
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
Not at all.  I'd like the nurse to be here, too.
Let him finish, Charles.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Emily!
Emily, you -
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
Ow!
Where's the soap?
I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?
You may be right -  I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
You're my wife, Susan, and -
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
Susan, I really think -
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
I'm going to leave you.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Don't go, Susan.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
Get Dr. Corey.
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
Yes?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
What check?
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
What's this?
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
Anything and everything - he was a regular crow.
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
Who told you you could sit down here?
How did you meet him?
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Am I sure?
Excuse me, but...
I think you'd better leave now.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
Yeah, but not in here.
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Wow. Hey, I was just about to order some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?
Exactly.
He went home to change for the big date.
Why aren't there any lights?
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Nobody! I swear!
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
You saw it?
So you're really getting married?
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
Stop it. He's a nice guy.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
Jesus, you're caustic.
So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.
I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
You have a better suggestion?
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
I left like an hour ago.
It wasn't me.
Stop this. This isn't funny.
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
This is the last time I come to this place.
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
So?
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
You only brought one ball?!
Shit!
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
Did you tell Veronica?
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
Eight and a half.
That's cheating?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Great story, isn't it?
That girl was vile to you.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
All four?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really is getting married.
Empire.
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
It would stand to reason, yes.
There's more?
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
Let's hear it.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
I don't back down.
Because you buckled.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
Pull my laces tighter.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
You know what Sanford told me? 
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
You've had sex with a dead person.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Stop it.
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Who found him?
He made it, hunhh?
I could never reach.
What, your dick?
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Let me borrow your car.
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
Jesus!
You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
You're happy?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
You're kidding.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Watch the store while I go home and change.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
Thirty-seven.
What responsibility?
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
Am I right or what?
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Make them change.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
Why do you say that?
How do you figure?
What time did you get to work today?
It's not like I'm miles away.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
Do I know you?
I'm her sister.
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Excuse me?
Oh for God's sake!
Did you say Caitlin Bree?
Yeah.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
A half hour.
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
With you? I don't think so.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
Don't you already have a girlfriend?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Lasagne.
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
Actually, that's his night job.
So I'm told.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
The white kind.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
At least they weren't lit.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Bunch of savages in this town.
You look bushed. What time did you get to bed?
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
She called you, didn't she?
Why do you say that?
Really?
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
How many girls have you slept with?
I'm not the pig you are.
All right. Name it.
Why do you call him that?
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
What do you mean?
How many dicks have you sucked?!
HOW MANY?
Lower your voice!
Um. Thirty-seven.
I'm going to class.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
I love you. Don't feel sick.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
What the fuck did you do that for?
What're you talking about?
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
A couple...?
I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
I'm not out of shape!
What's this?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
No way!
That doesn't sound metal.
To an Asian design major.
Sure. How about the beach?
You hope what feels good?
Well this is the last time I ever rent here...
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
He didn't ask me to...
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
Dental School.
I have first dibs.
Says who?
Like hell you are!
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Bye. 
What?
Answer the man.
What usually eats a banana?
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
It can't fly in this weather.
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Sarah, tonight why don't you and Hal come over for dinner?
Just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. Count it as you go:  One, two...by eight you'll be there.
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Use your other hand!  Grab it!
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Enough.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
Thank God you didn't leave.  We just got a Mayday.  Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
What are you doing here!?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
How'd you get up here?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
You attacked me.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Want me to lead?
Nice view, huh?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
What?
Reach up!  Do it!
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
We don't have time to argue about it!
Take the rope.
Enough's enough.  How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
Mr. Travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
He never hurt anybody.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
On top of the peak.
Go after her.
Got to be Comb Bluff.
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Oh, my God!
I don't trust him.
He's alive!
Is it set?
Why the hell are we wasting time here?!
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
Appreciate it.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Won't you join me, sir?
Help me, sir?
Who are they, sir?
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
What crime did you commit.
Good.
Good evening, my boy.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Fine, fine.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
What do I want?
You're gonna be sick are you?
You wanna be sick?
Yes sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Fair hair, sir.
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
No, sir.
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
How're you feeling this morning?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
I was quite enjoying that.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
You have, my son.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Yeah... Pete the English.
Moloko-plus.
How many to a cell?
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
A deer?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Jesus...
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
No.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
Lay it on me.
I'm sorry.
Can't say that I do.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
Jesus.  Two in one night?
I brought you flowers.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
I'm standing right here.
I was just tryin' to...to...
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Jesus, what is with this guy?
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
Yeah?  So?
It got crashed!  I didn't...
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
It's home.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
You on some kind of work plan?
It's not that kind of job.
Me, specifically?
Why not?
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
We have a deal.  What's your name?
I think he's dead.
You - you killed him?
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
You're cool.
Good.  Help me out here.
The trunk?
I don't think I can do this.
You listening to me?
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
You better?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
You said you were visiting friends!
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Are you breathing?
Music.
What'd he do to you?
How can you kill him like that?
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Another collateral.
I don't understand...
I listen to classical.
I never learned jazz.
What you mean, no?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
What difference does it make?
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
What, no insurance?
Gimme your wallet.
I don't get it.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
What's at Union Station?
You're full of shit.
And you believe me...?
What'd they do?
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
None of your business.
You're going too fast.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
I never told her.
The guy came right at us!
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Saved you last night's, too.
I don't see the connection.
Do you still ride?
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
For what?
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Them who?
As opposed to?
Yes.
Nothing is easy.
That's it?
So why are they after you?
Can you prove any of this?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Is he dead?
Not this again.
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Okay, I will.
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Jerry, I --
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Back where?
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
How'd you get the picture?
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
Blue moon...
What about you?
I love you, too.
That's great.  Good for you.
Liza Sutton is dead.
Thank you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
You made your decision yet?
I don't know...
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
<u>Why you</u>?
Excuse me?
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
This doesn't make sense.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
Tell me about it.
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
We've lost contact.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
What in the hell...?
Tell me.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
You're --
Peter sends his regards.
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
No doubt.
Ellie...
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
David --
What?  Why?
With me.
David --
Right.  Well.
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Could we hear to China?
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
Many others.
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
... life is unspeakably rare.  So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message.  Sometimes we can offer help.  Sometimes we can't.  But we always try.  Life is simply too precious not to.
So.  What happens now?
Not if you think like a Vegan.
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
The systems integration site.
Why don't you come back with me?
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about!  Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
Jesus --
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Wait -- hold on a minute --
Champagne please.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
Do you love your parents?
Maybe you're creating a monster.
If you came back.
What'd you think?
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
I don't follow.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
Ellie --
You're trembling.
I can't do this --
Please --
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
But --
Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
Git movin', I said.
I'll make it a dollar.
How'd you find me?
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
No. But things ain't always like they seem, Arletta. You know that. A man's gotta go his own way.
Go hard!
I don't know, Boss.
Git to work!
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Hey, Tattoo!
You can't do that!
Newmeat looks like a poker player, Drag.
But there's still daylight left.
A cold drink.
Whatta you so happy about?
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard road finally got to Mister Lucas War Hero.
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Where'd the road go?
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
We got it locked in the sock.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
What you mean, Luke?
On my own.
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
Do we even get our same bunks back?
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
Cuter again.
Man Oh Man.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Well, how far didya get?
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
Stop that.
What are you talking about?
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
I want to die.
When are you going to call them?
I can't, Andy.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Who are you?
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
What Friday?
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
Where is it?
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
You come and visit.
You know I can't do that.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Who is this?
Because of your phone calls.
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Is it an ongoing case?
For months... last October.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
Can you make a copy we can show on our computers?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
But it's a different m.o.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
What's that siren?
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
I don't want this.  What are they?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
Is there a phone booth there?
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
I was just about to advise the Inspector here not to show Dr. Hudson the note.
She is a writer, writing best selling books about serial killing. Giving lectures she's well-paid for.  Her interests are not the interests of law enforcement.
I was.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
What am I wasting my time with this shit for?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
Yeah.  And you used that. Used <u>me</u>
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
Answer it.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
What's wrong with him?
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
There was no sperm.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
I know.  Get out here.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
What the hell you need her for?
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
How'd you get in on the deal?
Give me Ruben back...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
Did you come?
There, that's better.
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
Where's the car?
It is?
It does.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
So - why the airport?
You're kidding.
Why are the police taking this all so seriously?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
You could get your wish at any moment.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
Patient.
I want to see my mother immediately.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
Then, you should call.
Maybe.
Please, Letty.
And the party?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
It'll be fine.
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
What's his name, Letty?
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Will you get time off to do that?
Are you sure, Dear?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Oh no.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
Ruth's already taken him home.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
I'm only looking out for you.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Honestly, Letty.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
Green spot.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
No.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
I wasn't hungry.
Very romantic setting.
Guess which hand.
Guess.
Good God.
No.
We're supposed to be asleep.
We'll get caught.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
Shocking, huh?
I wish I could have seen that.
Yeah.
I better make a list.
I love your apartment.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Who ever said sanity was fun?
You got wine. That's great.
Are you OK?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Why'd you tell?
Silly, silly, silly.
I guess so.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Yeah?
I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
You don't have a fever.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
No...
Here's the ring.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh.
I heard about your friend.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
Office work?
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
What are you doing?
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
They don't have a murder weapon?
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
They left about a half hour ago.
Who?
Oui.
You've already robbed the safe?
Oui.
What?
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
I'm good.   Really.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
Half the tapes.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I don't know.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond, you'll steal one.
Why is everything an argument with you?
Hopefully no one.
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
You want Zero to kill him?
Bring me the scissors.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
All right, knock it off.
Hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
You haven't answered my question.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
Man, I can get anything.
Don't bullshit me.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I've got a way with people.
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Yeah, French guys from France.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them, would you?
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
What room number?
I don't know.     I didn't look.
The map said to go left.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
What about transportation?
No, I didn't.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
I knew I should have driven.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
It's my idea.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
Anybody know about that car outside?
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
No shit?
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
You're not helping.
Algeria.
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
You ever hear of jet lag?
Did she break your heart?
Who's gonna see it there?
Can't sleep?
No.
Frankie, I --
What's this?
You're back!
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
Tell me, who is your master?
Please sit.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
This spells trouble.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
You're too young to understand.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
Where is he now?
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Give it back!
Kneel!
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Jen...
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
It has.  How's business?
Good.  And how are you?
Yes.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
What was it?
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
But something is going on at the Yu household.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
What about you?
I'll look around and catch up later.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
Save your strength.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
They're gone.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Talent. Hi.
You buying?
No onions?
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Don't interfere.
Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --?
Fun -- look at that guy...
You look like a rock star without a job.
Who?
Mister Funboy.
What's going on...?
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
I wish to possess what you have now.
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Does it hurt?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Get it?
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Blow yourself, bigmouth.
No shooting.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
"Our" Crow...?
That's right.
Thank you.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
You heard me.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
On my mother's life.
Got a boyfriend back home?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
What'cha reading?
That's a matter of opinion.
At this hour? I don't think so.
What? Another letter from your friend?
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
I never said that.
You implied it.
Why not?
No thank you.
Give it up.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Doing what?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
I'm... I'm alright.
Need any company?
What?
I do.
I don't.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
You know what? I don't take it back.
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I think that's for the best.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
How am I a hypocrite?
Hi.
Would you like a tour?
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why aren't you understanding?
I love you.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
Any ideas who it could be?
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
See that wasn't so bad.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Why didn't you do something?
He made you give him a blow job.
No.
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
What are you doing?
Just taking your photo.
Just a kiss, right?
Am I suppose to be this sore?
I like it better when I'm on top.
Where are you going?
I'm taking a shower.
Need any company?
Don't you want to change that?
Same time next week?
No. This is going to be our last session.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Who told you?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Oh baby... oh baby...
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Yes.
Yes!
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
And you think she bought it?
She bought it.
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
What are the terms?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Fuck her yet?
Blow me.
Call me later.
You would not believe what--
What's wrong with you?
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
No.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
Who are you spying on?
That her?
Nothing.
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Morning.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Bad time?
And that's why you're leaving?
P-whipped, p-whipped.
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
Well done.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Get out? We had an arrangement.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
First of all, maam, I never touched your daughter and second, I would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Annette! Annette!
Yes, you already did.
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Did you hit her?
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
Does she go up to the Farren's often?
How?
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
Oh, lots of times.
Where did you get this ring?
But where did you get it, Amy?
I'd hate her to grow up like that.
I know that.
What do you mean?
What is it, Alice?
Where did you get it?
What's funny?
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Is that where she got the ring, Mrs. Reed? She shouldn't be up there.
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
But wishes don't come true.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
These are all from me.
Yes, Amy?
Amy, there's nothing there. There's no one at all in the garden.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
What'd you get for Christmas?
No.
I've wanted a friend.
For as long as you'll let me.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
But you must!
Oh, thank you, Amy.
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
You mustn't be afraid.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Yes, Amy.
But why?
Look at my ring.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
I wasn't singing to myself.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
But I only came to give back the ring.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
No, thank you.
Mommy read it to ne.
The Headless Horseman --
Hide me? Why?
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
I didn't even have to coax her tonight.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks now, huh?
Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Nearly four.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Translation: a total geek.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
I don't know.
And she got the medium.
George bit you?
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
Maybe they have to pee.
Where?
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
And he was ripped limb from limb?
So did you do it?
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
What? Why the hell did he do that?
I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.
Give him the tampon test.
Okay. I guess so.
Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been?
Frida, Carlton's dead.
Oh no.
Why not? There's been a murder.
What? Why'd you do that?
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
No.
Peter knows something.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him.
I guess you'll find out.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
About Mark? Carlton?
I thought you and George were getting married.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
You're kidding, really?
So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.
Well, whattdaya think?
My apartment's just such a mess.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
Script coverage?
Did you change your hair?
I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
When's the last time you saw him?
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
You wanna get some coffee?
So what book did you buy?
No really, I love knowing what people read.
My mom used to get PMS too.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Yeah. Maybe.
Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.
No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this.
No. I was doing my laundry.
No, I got it. It's okay.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
No, but thanks for the warning.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
Is that how you feel?
What's with the squirt guns?
Your breasts feel larger.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
Go away. I might hurt you.
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
Be careful!
I ate a guy last night.
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
We didn't have sex.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?
Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive.
You got a dog?
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
She's just so... pathetic.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
Take some allergy medicine.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
I told you she was innocent.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
What makes her think that?
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
What kind of animal?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
Not really...
How will we interrogate them?
He tried to kill me!
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnt this his case?
Why do you want to speak to him?
Ill be the judge of that.  Anything else?
Im your new assistant.
You typed this report?
Who is it?
Where are we going?
Who?
Where do you think this goes?
What?  Who has?
But...  How long has this been happening?
Look!  This is a good one!
What is that door?
Such a joker!  Like your father.
Yes.
I see.  Then who is after you?  What sins have you committed?
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Bad dreams?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Known me for long?
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
I'm nothing then.
What are you doing?
Not that again...
I can't do that.  It's dangerous. What about my parents?  Do you know where I can find them?
Is this dangerous or anything?
First Lady...
They barely talk anymore.
Mr. President...
Alan
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
Die, you pond scum!
Don't call the Vice President!
... What?
Bob...
Mild stroke?
A condition...
What about her.
Clean.
Nobody's got clean kids.
When does it break?
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
He's only doing what you told him to.
Just what you think I mean.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
And who's gonna find out?
I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
I'm afraid so.
I'm not sure... I might have.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
A teleprompter.
Dave...
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
Yes, Mr. President?
And it's proving quite effective...
Why?
What?
I can't say.
No.
What's that?
You're kidding.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
I care about the homeless.
I don't understand.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Look.  If there was some mistake...
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
I really don't have much of an appetite.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
You find people jobs?
Yeah.  Is that funny?
I can't.
You really believe that?
Yeah.   He's a good man.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
It could be fun.
We're working on it.
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Please...senor...destroy me...one bullet...please.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
What is it?
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
What is it?
Tonight?
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
What?
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
Looks like just two. We can take 'em when the time comes.
What is it?
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
Yeah. My stuff's all marked with red crosses so nobody gets too nosey. Meet me at the hospital after the supplies come in. Maybe we can find a place there to talk.
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
We got a boat.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
Dios mia.
NOOOOOOOOO!
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
What'dya get?
Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
Don't come.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
What is the point?
What do you mean you don't know?
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Mr. Keating!
You know what really excites me about you?
Nuwanda?  Please?
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Hey, he's your roommate.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
It's Nuwanda.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
What good will that do?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Then come with me.
Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
Meeks.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
Yawp!
A sweaty-toothed madman
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Where are you going?
When you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  Until then, you will listen to me.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
I say we go tonight.  Everybody in?
What is this, a midnight study group?
So what do you think of my father?
I don't want to read.
What?
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
A Midsummer Night's Dream. What is it?
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
And now he will?
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
What is that supposed to mean?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
I will be with thee straight.
This play?
Yea, art thou there?
Put more into it!
How do we get out of here?
It's not going to help us!
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
Right here...middle of nowhere...
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Noooo!
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there?
I'm not rich people.
Anti social?
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
It's not them...it's it...
There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy...
If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island?
No...
I don't take orders at all.
Let's just keep going.
Shut up! You hear me!!
...Jagger was here...I was here...
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
What did you do the my kids!!
Me??
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
I don't know...you got what we need?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
And what have you come up with?
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Where are you going?
Maybe plans changed...
Nothing.
Check it out!
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked you?
She fucked us both.
We're all going.
Nick's going?
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
Ammo! Get the ammo!
Who's full of shit?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
It's Nick!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Who? Who is?
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
Where? Where is he?
I have to go.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Everybody love Linda.
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
You like to call me Linda now?
You know a guy named Merle?
Oh, well...
'Course how could you miss, right? Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean, if I'd'a been where you guys were --
No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
No?
Nick, she won't say why.
Biederman, yes.
Linda, Linda...!
Sure.
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car...  I thought someone stole you away!
No.
What are you doing?
Playing.
Yeah.
I don't think about the shot that much.
Hell no!
From Nam?
Promise! You gotta promise!
It's ahead, by the tree.
What are you, hoping?
What else?
I thought you might be praying.
Merle...
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
Watch it, shithead!
No.
No.
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
What's that noise?
What's that noise?
What?
Where?
It's Merle, Sal.
Yeah.
Yeah!
He's getting married... and we're nuts!
Well, who'd you get married to?
What the hell's that for?
Yeah.
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
What'cha got, Bennett?
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
Mug sheets.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
We have to talk.
Sir, your transmission's fading.
Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
Not the 'T' word.
Yes.
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
They're going to rob that bank.
I'll inform dispatch.
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Wanna come?
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Then what goes on in there?  What I mean is, what are you thinking about?
Bacon cheeseburgers.
NPA metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  That's when we'll get him.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
How then?
Why?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
I'll be okay.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
You want to be a good detective?
Yes, sir.
You're not pregnant, are you?
What else did he get?
Get us some fuck'n back-up now!
How ya feeling?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
I just heard.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You be careful.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
Demolition Man.
What's your name?
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
The people, Jabez -- the people.
You know that you're in my house.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Young man -- you got me there.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us.
Howdy, Hank.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Loan shark -- hey?
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
What do you want?
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Belle.
No, Stone!
-- in gold.
Where's everybody?
-- of what happens after we die!
Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday.  My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! 
Well, I'll be -- 
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
The seventh day of April --
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
I don't care.
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Leave your tongue off of that!
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
You know darn well it is.
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
Not long -- now.
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
The only one you missed -- is the President.
Why not -- ?
How much?
Down, Shep! Down!
Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate.
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Jabez!
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
You'll never change -- will you?
Mary --
I'll never get my washing done.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
It shows on your face.
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
Consarn the consarn --
You know that, son.
Hard luck -- like me.
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Ma -- is she? --
It's all right, Sheriff.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Mr. Webster, I presume?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Why don't you?
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
Like I said, Argyle...you're fast.
How 'bout some Christmas music?
So, you go on upstairs to the party, your lady sees you, you run into each other's arms.  Music comes up, you live happily ever after, that it?
Ellis, what have you told them?
John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy...
You're very perceptive.
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
The code key, please...?
You...you're an American?
New York...
One weekend I went to a combat ranch...  You know, that game with the, the guns that shoot red paint?  Must sound pretty silly to you...
Hans.  Your Hans.
Nein, dies ein ist mein.  This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Yo!
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Safe and sound, thanks to you. What the fuck was that?
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Al?  Al, you there?
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
Hey, you couldn't know.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
These seats come out?
You'll be okay.
Heidi, I'm dying.
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Well, how'll I get home?
It looks like a whole roast.
How are you doing?
I'm really shakey.
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
You're crazy.
Denmark?  Sweden?
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Shit...
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Yeah.
Do you still want the operation?
It's my only chance!
Right.  See you sometime.
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
What kind of things, Leon?
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
What are you doin' in there?
Who's this?
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
I'm not alone.
How many you got in there?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Call me whatever you want.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
Come on.  I want you to see something.
You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
Okay, what do you give me?
You tryin' to fuck me?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Is on its way ... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to Kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
There won't be ... there won't be ... What else do you need?  How else can we help you?
What else?
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
Now, you -- what's your name?
Well, they go to guard school.
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
I don't know, Sonny ... on the roof somewhere I guess.
Are we going to get the ball rolling?
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
Yeah?
You got Bank Americard?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Yeah.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Ah, Jesus...
Let's go, Sonny.
Goddamn women...
It's the cops.  Shit!
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
Does that still go?
You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends?  If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country.
Sonny -
Okay, Sonny.
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Aw, Jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
Bullshit!
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
I don't want him.
What can he do, he's clean...
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Okay, who's the head teller here?
I am.
Here's your document, Sonny.
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
Oh.  Run.
Robbing a bank.
You're news, Sonny ...
Newsman, not ...
And if you can't deliver them?
Where are we going?
<i>He killed two children.</i>
Tell him it's not cute. Will you tell him, Domino!?
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
What about your toe?
What?
Where are you? <b> INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT </b> Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He pulls into the Texaco parking lot.
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
Hello?
I don't know.
That's the rumor on the street.
No. Please enlighten me.
Everything. It is a ghastly existence.
God help us. God help us all.
Really? Did you play in a band?
How did you meet Choco?
Hello?
Cool it, Choco.
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
We are so fucked.
Do you know where Danang is?
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
I'm gonna leave now.
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
So, in other words, you are not down.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
Mookie.
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
You the man.
No, you the man.
How long?
The evil eye doesn't work on me.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
Is it a good morning?
Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
OK.  OK.
Eddie Lovell.
It's gonna be hot today.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Stop tripping.
Nice!
Jade, you're late.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
I didn't say nobody, I said you.
Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Can you pay me now?
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
I didn't say nuthin'.  You must have a guilty conscience.  What are you guilty of?
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
C'mon, Sal.
Sal, I want my money.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
How much?  How much do I owe you?
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
Before I get off work.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Hot.  Hot.
Tina, you are too slick.
I can't be staying long anyway.
Why you gotta curse?
Where are you going?
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
Da Mayor ain't no bum.
And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love you, but if I hate you...
Sez who?
I love you.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
I know.
I like Mookie a lot.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Hi.
Excuse me.
Yeah. How'd you know?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, Jethica?
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
You did?
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
O'clock?
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was Principal Collins?
Hey look, it's our teacher.
The name's Walter.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Wow just like Marco Polo.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Why not?
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
H A R R Y...
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
Yeah, he's a pirate.
Yeah, go-cart accident.
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Your mom made a move on me.
Will not.
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Collins is a great man!
No.
What's with horse-boy, now he's a bright shiny sun?
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Welcome to public school, my friend.
You're it.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
How do you know it's for us?
Some what?
Sure I do. On one condition.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
I kinda screwed things up.
Hey, where did you come from?
Do you want me to pet your head?
You certainly did.
You're it.
I lugged it all over town!
I made the polar bear pants.
What? What did we do?
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Wait, wait!
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Right.
What?
She's one of a kind.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
So can I come along?
Oh, you're good.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
Special Needs class.
You're just jealous.
What?
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
That's it. I'm done.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
That's my boyfriend.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
How much homework is there?
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
How was that?
Senior year. My little boy. Who woulda thunk it?  You're a good kid, Lloyd. I don't say it enough, but I'm proud of you son.
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
Obviously.
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
What?
Left here! Left!
I am strong!
God, I've missed you.
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
What?
You got the Extender?
So what do you keep in there?
The evidence of what?
It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
My thanks.
What's that you're saying?
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
Yes, my Lord.
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
My Lord?
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
You have strength... real strength... You shall be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  This is your secret name in our troop.  But you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
We call that one Muad'dib.
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
What's in the box?
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
THE PAIN!
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
The person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... He will look where we cannot.
Where?
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
Now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
But you're a big star!
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Ugh!  I hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  She doesn't show 'em the proper respect.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Who do I play?
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
Ah!  This is very exciting.
Let me take you to the hospital.
Should I call a doctor?
"Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
Don't let me slow you down.
Bela.  I just wanna thank you again for last night.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Why are you here??
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
What happened?!
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
And, cut...
Eddie, how was I?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
You mean a Tesla coil?
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
Who?  Robert Taylor?!
No!  A horror movie star!
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
It takes me comfortable.
Bela needs a job... I can't even get a film going...  But <u>of course</u> I can't -- I made the worst movie of all time.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
I told you this was gonna happen.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Honey, you made it! I wasn't sure you got my message.
That's right...
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
I understand you just moved here?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
I kinda need it now.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
He's a <u>bum</u>.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
So anyway, I've got this new script, "Bride Of The Atom," and there's a part you're ideal for: "Lobo."  He's tough.  A brute.  But he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
I'd be happy too, if I had such a great family.
Excuse me, Sir...?
Yes?
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
So you're not a fruit?
Tits.
Why would Lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
There's still a sex-change --
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
They'll notice.  Look, why don't you let me take over from here?  I can do a few tricks: Pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell, I even built the props.
Why not??
Maybe it needs special handling.
Hello.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
The marriage already ended.
Oh, it's you again.
You look beat.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.
No! I love sex with girls.
Uh, atomic energy?
No, BIGGER!  What's the biggest energy??
The sun.
I can't get it to go up.
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
Yes!
Well I was thinkin' like, when Bela played "Fu Manchu."
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
What are you talking about?!  It's the premise of the movie.  It's even the title, for Christ's sake!
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
I thought this was a group effort.
B-but it's our money --
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
You mean like a date?  I thought you were a fag.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
What do you love her or something?
Who?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
Cool.
That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay?
No, uh...
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Yeah?
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
He's who we want to go with.
This guy.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Right, right...
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
He had girlfriends!
He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
She could've been a nurse.
Could've been a nurse?
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Oh God. What hospital?
St. Joseph's.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
To you? In front of him?  With the...
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
No.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
You batted or you bunted?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Well, then I'm quitting.
Hey, Lou.
Yeah...
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Ha!
It's... okay
I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
Leave. Go.
Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out.
I know, I ...
... yeah, then, but...
Ohh...
Really? 
So?
I'm sorry.
Where?
Okay.
I need to talk.
Are you all right?
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
The what?
Kinda'.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
What are you drunk?
Show business.
Thumbsucker!
I got your message. Way to go!
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
I don't know.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
All right.
No. What happened?
What's the dif --
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Hi.
You watching the ballgame?
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
Please!
I know.
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Good-bye, brother!
Come on, Ma.
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Do you still have it?
Hi.
We have to stop meeting like this.
No.
Ohhh...
Ed?
Sign here, please.
That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
pierdes.
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
what?
Thank you.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
Larry?
Yeah?
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Well, good luck there, Tracy
Tracy.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
Here they are.
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Sure
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
I told you!  I told you!  You're going to pay for my banner!
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Plenty of pep, too.
Uh-huh.
Oh, is this...?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Uh, Jim?
Door was open.
I don't believe you.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
Here?
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Still clear?
Hey Yeah?
Yeah.  I'm here.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
What do you mean?
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
Are you crazy?
People can see this.
So?
For what?
I mean at you.
Who put you up to this?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Don't you fucking knock?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
You dumbshit!
What'd I do?
I just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
Now could you leave me alone?
What's it to you?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
Do you enjoy it?
When they deserve it.
Look.  I want to see you again.
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
In the morning.
Call me Dudley.
Dudley, what do you want?
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
Give me one minute.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
Let my daughter rest in peace.
What happened?
One in six.  Where's the girl?
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Why?
Lynn.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
Dudley's guys.
Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
What about him?
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
I don't know him.  Mr...
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
No.
Then you wouldn't feel obligated to report them?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
What do you want to know?
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
Whose shoe?
Susan Lefferts.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
Clean?
Where are the police academy files?
Say what and so what.
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
I never truck with no sissies!
That fucking Larry.  I almost believed him.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
Say what?
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes!
And?
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
No.
White's a mindless thug.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
There are loose ends out there, Dudley.  I --
No... Where'd the tip come from?
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
<u>No</u>.
Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
I need to speak to you.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
I want you to follow Bud White.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
What are you going to do?
What's on the call sheet?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
A vulgar term, but yes.
What's her name?
Not good enough.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
You sound like you mean it.
I'll take your word for it.
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Do you have any proof?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
Officer White?
A sweet man.
Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance?
Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns.
<u>Hush-Hush</u>.  Off the record and on the Q.T.
Something good?
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
What happened with the kid and Loew?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Was it a party?
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
I'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show... But tonight? Pretend it's an acting job, kid. Showbiz.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Oh?  Anyplace else?
What happened?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
I don't know what that means.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
Listen--
Turn on CNN.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
No one. But I'm a little nervous.
What kind of a question is that?
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Really?
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
What <u>is</u> that?
It's a SAT-tracker.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
They're spooks.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.
Get dressed. We're leaving.
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
I mean did you call anyone.
I didn't use my name.
Sorry.
I didn't use my name.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
They're here.
<u>Here</u>?!
You sure?
We're not gonna hurt you.
Drive.
No he won't.
So what do we do now?
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
How?
No.
We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know?
Pretty fast.
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
He came in four minutes ago.
Feeling lucky?
Baudmore Consultants.
Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name--
Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Is it okay?
I'm married.
That's fine.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Very good.
I know, but--
The robbery.
About what?
You tell me.
No, sir.
Was he with anyone?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
No.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
Bobby!
Just for the criminals.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Have you been working with Rachel?
You <u>swore</u>!
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
Stacy--
Stacy, don't hang up.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
I know.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
I <u>told</u> you they could do this. I <u>told</u> you they had this kind of capability and that with this anti- terrorism it would be just another--
That was for Christmas.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
I'm sure we can locate it for you, sir.
I don't believe it is, no.
How's the trout?
It tastes like fish.
Do you like fish?
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Brill?
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
Good. You're just what I need right now.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
That's temporary.
How?
You have to.
I <u>did</u> care how.
Yeah?
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
Your shoe.
Hey!
God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening.
Good point.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
Mr. Dean--
Robert--
Sure, go ahead.
Dad!
Are you and mom getting a divorce?
How long can you stay?
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
They only took electrical appliances.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Jerry--
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Calm down.
Jesus.
They're framing me.
I don't know. I mean--
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
To the cops?
I'm sorry, man.
Yeah?
He got hit by a bus.
Why not?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
What?
Who?
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i><u>fucking</i></u> <i><u>phonebook</i></u>?!
Sir--
Lyle?!
No sir.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Yes?
Federal Express?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
It was pulsing on your SAT frequencies.
Yes?
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
How much did you pay?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
I do not.
What's this?
See what's happening to them - the stars.
No.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Will you not come in?
Will you please come in?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
What do you hate most?
A lie.  What do you hate most?
This is empty, just coming!
Arabic?
I don't care to bargain.  It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
What?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
Tell me about your garden.
A broken car?
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
It's Geoffrey under this.
Sorry, what's your point?
I see.
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
No.
I don't know.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
Where did you find that?
I liberated it.
Buon' giorno.
Hello.
Are you planning to be the exception?
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Irving Berlin.
Hana tells me you're leaving.
Me?
Oh.
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
What?
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Are you asleep?
I can see my wife in that view.
Are you crazy?
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
He needn't disturb you.
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
I've been told that before.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
No!
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
Where's your Stuart from? Somewhere near there, isn't it?
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
I've met you before.
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
This is hot!
Of course.  When?
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
Hello.
Hello miss.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Does he have to go?
I had a hotel room.
What's happening?  Am I needed?
I don't think so.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
What are you talking about?
No.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
So he popped the pane?
You ordering chop suey again?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
I don't know, but close.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Uh. I'm showing off.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
No you can't.
I don't want to waste your time.
You have a car?
Uh, yes.
I've got something for you.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
Possibly.
A film case.
What about your bags?
Those are my clothes.
I don't believe this.
Lose something?
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
Only a week?
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Why don't we take oxygen?
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
I trust it's your size.
Thank you.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
You're nervous again.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
He wasn't.
Camera in the--
It's a party.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Well...What are we doing?
Peoples China Bank.
That's where the Mask comes in.
So how long till we do this?
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
You have something in mind?
Oh, I don't care about the money.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
The door's the only way out!
No way.
Put this on!
What's wrong.
But--
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
Always in a rush.
Which is--
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
The key to success is using the right tools.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
Suspicious, after all these years?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
250,000?
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
A million things could have caused those problems.  Poor diet, bad genes, irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final and more than fair.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
What the hell is this doing here?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
So you say.
Usually, in adults, it's from exposure to bacteria or a virus or ...
Hi.  Donna Irving?
You're a lawyer?
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
It's a good day.  I feel good.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Five million dollars?
Any school you want.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
You never called me back.  I left messages.
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
So you think we got 'em scared?
At least they made an offer.
I don't get why they'd do that.
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
Bullshit.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
How many families we talking about here?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
Hey.  I like working with you.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Is that what you want?
I'll see what I can do.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Why good?
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
No one's taking anything --
Uh-huh.
When?  Where?
You're not gonna be there.
Fuck Kurt.
Erin --
I don't know what to say.
Say you were wrong.
What is that?
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Nope.  And I didn't ask.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Nope.  Maiden.
You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time here.  Why don't you let me do that for you, and you can get your kids some dinner.
There's more than one kind?
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
Hey, Ros, where are they?
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
She's one of the sick people?
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
Great.  Another deadbeat.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
What're you doing?
Thanks for reminding me.
Great.
I'm just saying --
Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
Lock the door.
That is not what I'm --
About this.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
I can't leave my job, George.
More than you need me.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
Hello?
I'm embarrassed.
That's okay.  I understand.
Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
You're moving away?  When?
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
Right, I guess those are the kids --
It was .... the Emperor ....
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Barks his concern.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
I have felt it.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Sit down, and shut up!
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
Yes, Your Highness?
Does Luke know?
We?
Not you?
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
What was it?
An Imperial probe droid.
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Asteroids!  Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
You mean a man you can control.
I do not!
Are you crazy!
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
You look silly.
No thanks.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Thanks to you.
No hard feelings?
Are you kidding?
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
This ought to be good.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
Luke!
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
Rather touchy, aren't they.
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
I have followed my feelings.
Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
I can't. It's too big.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
But tell me why ...
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me, together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
Did you call the Zoo?
The Zoo tells me that chimpanzees, like all apes, are vegetarian, sir.
What, Lewis?
L.A. is in a constant state of warfare. Gangs fighting for the right to rule.
Heavy Third World connections. They get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
Why should we leave? I love L.A. Where we gonna go? What's the payoff?
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
I'm already dead.
She's overloaded! We're too heavy.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Shut up, Plissken.
And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
Where do I put ashore?
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
Locked.
Plissken...?
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Delgado?
Stop the damn car.
Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.
Sure, Snake. No problem.  You gonna kill me?
Later.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
How do you know all this?
What're you doing in here?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Who?
Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
What the hell is this?
The freeway.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
The President's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
Is he coming?
I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
But your life and lands are far from here.
He can be no other.
How? Where?
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy.
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic...
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
Yes.
Rise, Mordred.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
I left it in the tent, sir.
Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it.
You freed it, son?
I'm going.
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
And you cannot love me...
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
No, no, of course not. You are young...
I'm not jealous!
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
Now you must pay me.
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
I don't know. No, not really I suppose. But I've made a prudent judgement that it meets the conditions set down in the Ritual.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Hi, how'd your day go?
What the hell do you mean going out and leaving Regan by her self! What are you kidding her window's wide open...
What did the doctor say?
No, she was heavily sedated.
Yes, I'm affraid it is.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
Yeah or maybe rats now will you just get those traps.
There is nothing.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
A man to see you.
Morning.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Is it coming out Willie?
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Depression?
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
She used those words?
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Are you sure?
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
He didn't mention her.
Priests keep pretty tight mouthed then?
You wouldn't.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
You could do it yourself...
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
What?
Is she gonna die?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Hey, where'd this come from?
I found it.
You've been playing with it?
Wait a minute you need two.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Who's Captain Howdy?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Well you know it's okay.
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
I don't want it.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
You just missed them.
How's the girl?
She seemed fine.
What's playing.
Withering Heights.
Another one. Had your lunch?
Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
You and Regan?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Who are you?
No.
Amen
Why this girl it makes no sense?
Her heart.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the churchyou think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Yeah, a fall.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Who's in it?
I've seen it.
MERRIN!!!!!!!
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Are you a relative?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
It's my goddamn car!
Your pay.
What're you saying, Charlie?
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
Just the same.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Baker.
What's wrong with them?
They gotta go.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Two at a time?
How's the birthday girl?
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
I hate your kids, Frank.
You're their uncle.
Cindy.
What d'ya got?,
Seeing anyone in particular?
Uh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?
Funny.  Strike a bell?
So do I.
We gotta go, Jack.
I made her nervous.
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Jack.
What?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
Talk.
Sure, why not.
I'm not unhappy.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Oh, brother.
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
He's drunk.
You leaving that on?
Yeah.
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
Yeah.  You mind?
Christ, can't you hear it?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Because I can hear it.
What?
What's the matter with you?
How dare you say you love me.
Two hours ago!
No. Why?
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
Funny, huh?
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
Huh?
He's with the hotel.  I called him.
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
How come I didn't hear anything?
What're you doing down here?
Celebrating.  Join me?
The party's over.
Couple years.
A useless talent.
What do you mean?
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
We're not getting paid then.
What's it for?
What disease?
I don't know.
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
Right.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
No.
Five years ago.  November.
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
So she's got a few sniffles.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
How should I take it?
You're an hour and a half late.
We ran long.
I sing now?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Changed?
A seven.
I wear a seven.
The switch.  Hit the switch.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
I don't believe it.
Smells like fish.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Peggy Lee?
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
I can't sing it anymore.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Whatcha doin' over there?
Funny hours.
Brought it.
He doesn't bite.
No.
Where's egghead?
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Forget it.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Like a baby. You?
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
I can keep the beat.
What's that supposed to mean?
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
You were good.
How do you know?
Nina?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
Soap convention.
The both of them?  In there?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
Nervous?
You're kidding.
You can always get another girl.
So ... ?
Yeah.
What kind?
Losing his teeth.
What happened to the donut king?
Is that what you used to do?
I guess it's getting serious.
Older than me.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
How'd the show go?
Jack.
Fine.  You?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Eddie.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Like I had a choice with that anal-retentive Jon Archer rising my ass at the probation hearing.  At least he took an interest. You took off without leaving so much as a Post-it.
Nice-looking kid.
Go on, Adam ...  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.
Why would he need more?
Or reactivated the first one.
Pollux ...
I was in a coma, Pollux. I still feel like shit.
I don't know.  Everything's jumbled -- so you're going to have to help me fill in a few blanks.
A few blanks?  Like what?
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
For what?
For being one helluva guy.
She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
No.
How come?
Whoever you are, don't call again.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
What are you going to do, Castor?
What are you going to do!
What -- what are you doing?
Jamie ...
They're too tight.
You'll what?
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
What are you -- stupid?
Kim?
I'm just having some fun.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
The hospital.
Gone?
I'm not going anywhere.
You always say that -- then you leave.
What's on your mind?
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
Im not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
And I know people.
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
Got it.  Good tip.
Where do I go now?
Big Eds?  Big Eds Tires?  Why...?
Maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
What are you doing?
Is it morning yet?
Im having kind of a bad day.
Trouble at work?
She said that?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Its me, Jack...
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
We bowl together. Were bowlers ...we won a championship...were winners.
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
Got a minute, Jack?
Yes you do...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
You just said everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  Youre making a business deal...
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
Its lovely...
I dont think so, thank you...
Evelyn, right?
It would help me if we were.
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Why dont you let me take this one, Kenny?
Sorry, pal.  Entrance is for residents and guests only...
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
Because thats where I live.
Fine, shes the kids dog.  Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Hello!
Thanks, Jack...
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Sure.  I really like Annie.
The trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
You had a heart attack?
If you want to look at it that way...
Cmon, you know what I like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Youre so...beautiful...
I could stay here forever...
Are you out of your mind?
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
Promise me again...
You look great.
Im moving to Paris...it was right here...  Its a box marked Jack.  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
So youre not at a non- profit firm?
Youre not married, are you?
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
Hello Jack.  You dont have to stop singing on my account...
For the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...
Okay, Ill take them...
Hey, my wifes in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
I found it!
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
Five times.
The shields on the station should protect us.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Are you alright?
What the --!
You got a chisel round here?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
It's about to be a broken face.
Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine.  I think if we can rework the power settings...
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
No more cracks about how I look.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Ben, come in.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
I can handle the ship.  I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition.  But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits.  Who the hell came up with them?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
He didn't.
He didn't mean it.  You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
What?
This is wrong in so many ways.
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
So are you!
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
What is that <i>thing</i>?
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
I'm driving.
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Then what is it?
How's the IPO?
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Ben's still out there --
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
You know, I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you...speak his mind.  One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
Okay to proceed.
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
What is it?
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
I'd hold that off awhile.
The Other Side got to him.
I don't mean to be inquisitive. But this <CMDF> -- for all I know it could stand for <Consolidated Mobilization of Female Delinquents>?
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
A long time, with one man.
Then how come it worked loose?
Shouldn't you answer that?
You must carry spare parts --
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
Doctor, what's wrong?
What can we do?
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
What's that?
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
A what?
If there's any chance --
There it is!
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Skipper, you're picking up seaweed -- or whatever it is.
They're tracking us Topside. Once they see where we're going, I'm sure they'll take every precaution.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
May I?
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
All in all, quite a canoe...
Uh -- what?
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
I'll never find my way through that.
Was there any damage?
The Wall's transparent...
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
Have ya been to the Celebrity Room before? With other, uh, clients?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
She started shrieking, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
Yeah, you already said that.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
...The heck d'ya mean?
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
Yah, okay, but, uh -
Yah, but this TruCoat -
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Oh, now he's adorable.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
Oh, he's adorable.
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Yah.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Yah, got a front movin' in.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Where you girls from?
They said they were goin' to the Twin Cities?
Yah?
Uh-huh.
You're not a C student.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
You bet.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Yah.
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Huh? Yah?
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
...Brainerd?
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
We run a pretty tight ship here.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Yah, real good. How you doin'?
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Yah, how much money was that?
Jerry Lundegaard.
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
It's okay, Scotty.
Where're you going?
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Yah.
Okay.
...Is everything okay?
...Who they playin'?
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
Yah.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
Well, a course they're gonna say that! But where's my protection? They got Jean here! I give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go.
A million dollars is a lot a damn money! And there they are, they got my daughter!
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
...There's a million dollars here!
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yah.
You look in his citation book?
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah?
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
No, that's okay.
Yah.
Yah, that's me.
Yah - how are you doon?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Great. What brings ya down - are ya down here on that homicide - if you're allowed, ya know, to discuss that?
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
Well, they're a good outfit.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
I'm sorry.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Hello?
...Hello?
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
No.
Linda Cooksey?
Oh. Oh, my.
Oh. Geez.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
- looking.
Still missing. We're looking.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Whose car?
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're real good.
Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
...So?
Three-cent stamp.
It's just the three cent.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
Yah, I guess.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
He's at Norstar.
You are a moron.
No.  I found something new.
Yeah, both of us.
You need to make these your primary "action items."
We need to talk.
Let's pretend.  You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  Fuel injectors that burn people alive.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Dynamite?
This is... really a shock...
Who do you think could've done this?
Can't you give me something?
What?
I'll expose you.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
A year?  How'd you manage that?
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
You can't have the whole brain!
How did you find me?
That's the idea -- we split them.
You haven't been going to yours.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
Please.
Make sure.
I think everything's okay here.
Uh ... nah.
Whatever.
What?
We did make love?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
What is wrong with you?
I'm sorry, I...
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Why are you doing this?
Who's this?
What do you do, Tyler?
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
What?
Well, uh... great.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Insurance'll cover it.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Can I stay at your place?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
No.  That's a good thing, isn't it?
Where do you want it?  In the face?
How do you feel?
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
What fight?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
Alive or dead?
Good answer.
You?
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
Tyler...
I asked you what you studied.
Hey.
I want to know --
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
What are you talking about?
This conversation...
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
What's this all about, Tyler?
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
What... what are you saying?
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
What about them?  They're lunatics.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
I can't let you...
I'm going to...
...stop me?
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
I quit.
Ask me nicely.
Please...
Paraffin.
How'd you do that?!  You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...
Look at me...
Maintenance.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?
There is no money.
Ain't that something?
Yes, it is.
What are you doing?!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
S-S-Stuff.
Biology, mostly.
Why?
I... I don't know...
Yeah, how?
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
You have to tell us now.
What did you see?
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Random, sure.
I'm not sure I understand.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
What?
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
May we come in?
What was the fight about?
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Yeah?
What's going on here?
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Tell me again how it started.
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
I'm not following you --
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
This is cheery.
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
Um, Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
Shouldn't we pull over?
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Can I ask you a question?
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
And you're gonna die after me, right?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
What feeling?
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of...
"It?"
Is that something you're "feeling?"
This place?!
Remember the departure time?
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Carter, get out!
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
You're the fuckin' devil.
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
It broke!
SHUT UP, BILLY!
Wow!
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
Yeah.  Why not?
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
I've seen worse places.
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
No cigarettes.
American?
Roundeye.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
You're gonna love it.
You really got a Masters Degree?
Why's that?
Are you okay?
You think you are... .
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
That's an order.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
What?
You think they'll find any?
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
It's not necessary.
Take your time.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
Colonel.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
But now it's free, right?
Well did you or didn't you?
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
You're kidding!  What did he say?
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
Parry?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
A real nice place I know... Ah...can't get there! Not tonight.
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day.  Are you going to be all right?
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
Come on now...You can't sit here.
I... I was just leaving.
Fine.  I'll say no.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Yes.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
So how do we do this?
Now what?
They're --  -- What?
They said you're The One.
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
I'm not married.
Why did you do that?
Can I take you to lunch?
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
Are you all right?
No just Parry.
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery.  In subtitles.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
Well, it's enough for me.
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
I leave it to you.
Well, id'n that nice.
You're not going to play it again.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
Come on. We're goin' over to Elton's.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I know you're not.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
Okay, Ray...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Bobby...
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Well...
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
No substitutions.
Wait, I've made up my mind. I want a plain omelette, forget the tomatoes, don't put potatoes on the plate, and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
You want me to hold the chicken.
We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
You know who it once belonged to?
Who's Van Oost?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Oh, well, what, what's he...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
Yes, it is. I can't take seeing him, sitting there like a stone.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
What questions?
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Do you want some gingerbread?
What?
Where is she, anyway?
Where's Catherine?!
You're leaving?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
That's dangerous, you know.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
The day after tomorrow.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
You don't call that music, though.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Thank you.
You had no inner feeling?
I don't think that's accurate...
That's right.
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
No, I can't...
Will you let me talk to you, please?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
And what about love?
Well...
That's an old maid's tale.
You better hold onto your tongue!
Mass production is what does it.
John believes in the basic goodness of man, and that's fine, but gaze into the pit like I have and that view seems a little soporific. And not unlike television, it hardly represents the real world...
Miss Dupea.
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Aaron, how you doin'?
Fine.
Not now, I'm busy
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Yo.
So watcha doin'?
Of course.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
Just chill.
How you treat them?
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Who gives!
C'mon.
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
How does he look up close?
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
Like this?
Yeah.
Wha'?
You here to see somebody?
What she look like?
She didn't say she had no man.
Positive.
How do I know you're not lying.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
No.
Hey!
Yeah.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
I ought to get some sleep.
Nineteen.
Fletch.
I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
What the hell are you doing here?
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
That's two.
Well, which one?
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Just relax....
There is?
No idea.
Like tonight.
You don't know me.
I'm serious, Sam.
Affirmative.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
What?
It's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take another peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have they done with this place?
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
That's it.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
My lawyer was a bum.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Read this, please.
Wait a second --
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Well, I'm fully covered.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Regulations, Mr. Stanwyk. And you and your wife, named....
Ten days ago?
Then he has.
Its okay. The cops did it.
I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Rio de Janeiro, maybe?
We can't talk about it here.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Why don't you try suicide?
So why pick me?
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I'm still here.
They serve dinner on the flight?
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
That's right.
Will you kill me?
Deal.
'Magic' today, huh?
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
She's cute as a button.
No, thank you.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
John Ultrarelamensky.
That's a strange combination.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
I have this effect on lots of women.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
What's he doing in Utah?
Who is it?
Hi.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I really should change.
I mean put clothes on.
I saved his life during the war.
Why'd you let me in?
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Good point.
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
Yeah.
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
How do you know about that?
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
I'll take you to a game.
Wait a second. What am I supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
What's wrong, Gail?
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
You can't do that.
Don't tell me I can't --
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
In her cabana, sir.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
So you're saying she moved out.
This morning.
Fletch.
Uh, almost.
Two...
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Utah?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
I have some ideas.
You'll have it.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
You were going to can me, right?
Not really?
Who's Frieda?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
No, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
All your friends call you Jazz.
So what about this watch?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
What did you... Hey, where's your spex?
Hello, Ford...
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Let's get serious...
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Nice left you got there, jerk.
Are you okay?
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Ouch.
Where's my father?  Have you even looked?
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Who's my real father, man?
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
Why do you hate me?  It's gotta be more than Me Private You, You Cop.
Two words.  Disco Express.
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Polo.
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
How's it going?
The point?
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
I knew your father.  He was quite...
Well, hello, Ford.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Jazz, we're talking here.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Fuck me...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
Only on a first name basis.
Hi, private eye guy!
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
What?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Boca?
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Who knows?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Well try, okay?
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Yeah?
Did you pick up the car?
It is waiting for you in the garage.
I wasn't looking.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Je crois qu'on fait une erreur de le prendre avec nous.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
There's nobody like that on six.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Marseilles.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin' from the cops?
I hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  I come by to help you carry out your money.
Where the hell is it?
Christ you should o' collared him right there.
A bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
Who is that guy?
Give who a tail?
Monica?  Who's Monica?
I think we oughta burn him on suspicion.
Yeah.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Butch called.
Frank...what's wrong?
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
I'm serious.
Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody...  I'm on with John - that guy I told you about.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
Frank, we need to talk...
What do you mean?
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Okay, start pedaling.
I'm scared.
Wait...
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Where are you transmitting from?
I thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What?
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
Uh huh...
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
What the hell...
What's going on?
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Too busy playin' ball, huh?
No wait, don't go!
It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault.  You went with the training, with your instincts.  If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it.
It did, Pop.  It did.
Dad...?
Chief?!  Is that you?
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
Are you alright"?
Something happened, something...
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
We're okay...we're good, Dad.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
He took your wallet?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
My father didn't die in a fire?
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
What?
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
I try to be.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
You used to be on the job?
I look familiar?
A hot shot, huh?
No kiddin'?
Hell-
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an att --
Fuck you, asshole.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
What're you gonna do?
Breakfast?
What was that?
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
What's the matter?!
Nothin'.  I was just foolin' around.
Will you come with me?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
What are they saying?
Come on down!
What?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
What do you mean?
And, what about us?
That scarecrow?  Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Got any good ideas?
What're you doing?
No time to explain.  Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  Okay?
You don't "have to."
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
I'm getting real tired of this maniac.
Better get out the Hefty Bags... Looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
....with a woman's touch.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
My ass.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
What?
Uh...yes.  But...
You got it.  Just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
It's all over.
Okay, give it back.
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Wait a minute. I just...
So what happened?
Nancy.
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Why didn't you cremate him?!
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
I'm here.
I need to talk to you.
I'm going to kill Jason Voorhees -- and I need you to help me.
Jason Voorhees is dead.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Tell me.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
Okay.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught?
What murders?
Right.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Christ...where's Rennie??
I'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, Miss Mason. You'd better have your biology project ready or I'm phoning your parents.
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
I...I can't...
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You had me worried to death!
But Sean said...
Get in the boat, Rennie!
I...I can't...
It's not that simple.
I heard you weren't coming.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Where are they?
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
You are going where?
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Alla puttanesca.
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
Shut up, Elliot.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Don't talk like that.
Very dangerous.
Asbestos lining.
What do I exude?
Tonight. What's tonight?
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
That's what I said eighteen months ago.
Do we care?
Do not inhale.
I'm not ready.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
Shoot him.
Great game.
This could be it.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
Does it feel comfortable?
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
I hear Alan's sick.
You know about Adele.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
In and out of bed.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
That's completely crazy.
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
She is kicking you out.
Opening night?
Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
I'm willing to tell you my name.
What else?
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
All right. What's been going on?
How prominent?
Opening night, Lillian.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
Joanne Bourne.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
I am really, deeply sorry.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
A thousand things.
This could be it!
Who is it?
Where the hell are you?
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
We must have been heroic.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
Since when did that matter?
My back is killing me.
Where's your elastic brace?
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
What do you want me to do?
It's the kid's lucky day.
What am I doing?
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
I want to believe.
Because life is good.
This could be it!
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
Postpone. We have every right.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
Sidney remains optimistic.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
Yes.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
So does Elliot.
A little.
Say it again.
What?
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is what true?
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Yes.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
Just an admirer...
That's the sort of thing you'll be seeking on this "farm"...
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
You will respect the law.
You're an ambitious man.
It's beautiful.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
You've done me a great service.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
You mean a general strike?
Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
You mean you employ Mr. Baker as your attorney, but you can't walk down the street with him?
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
Perhaps some tea?
All right. Fine.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
And that's the basis of this "Declaration of Independence"?
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
Could we cut all news off? I know --
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
It's for the best.
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
We were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
What a pity.
--There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
From what budget?
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
Hello.
Jerome--?
Good to see you're feeling better.
Don't be deceived, Irene.  These are just the clothes.  He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
What's wrong with him?
You okay, Jerome?
What's wrong with it?
It needs work.
You had to be a right-hander.
It's not too late to back out.
The Mission Director.
That's not the point.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
How long do you stay up there before you go?
It's okay, Eugene.
It's all right.
Any particular reason?
What makes them think that?
They found my eyelash.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
Is that all?
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Everybody goes there.
How are you, Jerome?
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
Where are you going?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
He has the heart of an ox.  He could run through a Goddamn wall--if he could still run. Actually, he was a big college swimming star.

Yeah.
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Were <i>you</i> alone?
We were just looking.
In the South Wing.
Does it have a name?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
I envy you, Jerome.
You'll be next.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
What exactly is wrong?
Who are they?
Come on.
Jerome...never shy.  Pisses on command. You've got a beautiful cock.  I ever told you that, Jerome?
What's this, Lamar?
Sure,  You're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
I'll take care of my end.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
You okay?
Yeah.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
You go out much?
It's all right.
Really?
I was going to fix you breakfast.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.
Yeah... I know.
That doesn't hurt.
For exits off Main Street.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
Waiting's hard. You never learn how.
Bullshit.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
He might be ready to chop us up.
Do you trust him?
I don't want to go there.
Yeah.
Who's she?
He must have.
Fifteen minutes.
What?
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
No scars?
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
Sounds good.
Can we make it?
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
You okay?
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Oh my God.
Can I help you?
You were with him?
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Two.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollies. Okay. Any questions?
Aren't we going a little hard?
What do you have in mind?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
What's it to you?
'Bout five thousand.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
You're going to have to walk back to the border.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
You do what he says, Harold.
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
How?
Nothing. What could I do?
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
Yes. I told him.
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
What about?
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
Why?
I don't know. All I know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day, he was dead.
Confidential, like.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
Do you?
I know him too.
Sid Fletcher.
Oh, do you?
Yes. I met him last year.
We went about together.
While he was here. You went about together?
Was he?
So where are we going, Princess?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Is he coming here?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
Tell me about the girl.
Was it Albert?
Yeah.
Expect so.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
No. It's all right.
Thanks for coming.
Sorry about your father.
Where you going to live, then?
Wilton Estate.
Don't know.
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
What you having, Jack?
Heard of a man called Thorpe?
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
How many?
Did they give you a rough time?
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
I'm sorry.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
They bloody hurt me.
What about Keith?
Are you awake?
Are you tired?
No. Are you tired?
No chance of that.
Not much.
What you going to do?
You coming back?
Is he?
What you doing around here then?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, that's nice.
It would be. If they were still living.
They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow.
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Eric told me of your bereavement.
Gerald wants to see him first.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
All right. Two hundred.
I'll see you, then.
I'm not?
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
They did.
I...
It's not.
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Eh?
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
Nurses.
Yes.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
You don't ax your sales force.
You...
They...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Huh.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Did you?
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Did I say that?
Is that what I said?
What will he pay?
You're saying "me."
Yes.
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
They're going to come to everyone.
Why would I do it?
I didn't ask to be.
That's right.
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Can we get some coffee...?
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
It's a waste of time.
I am?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
...what am I going to do all month...
To the cops?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
The cops?
No.
Yes.
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
No, who?
What?
The leads come in, I'll let...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Would you excuse us, please...?
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
Who told you...?
And I don't want any fucking shit and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts me over the top, you filed it, that's fine, any other shit kicks out you go back.  You...you reclose it, 'cause I closed it and you...you owe me the car.
You have a problem?
Could I...
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
Mr. Levene...?
...you didn't close...
What two?
...no...
Roma.
Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April, September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an order taker, John.  He talks, he talks a good game, look at the board, and it's me, John, it's me...
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
...you talk to Murray...
I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
Then put me on the board.
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Alright.
What are we going to say?
I saw the board.  You've got four...
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
Yes, I am.
What are you trying to tell me?
Why I don't...
Excuse me...
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
He told me my share was twenty-five.
Because I don't like you.
John: John:...my daughter...
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
"You do get the opportunity...You get them.  As I do, as anyone does..."
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
Just now.
Fuck you care...?
Like you taught me...
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Go ahead.
Well, Ray was eating at one of his company's men's home in France...the man's French, isn't he?
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
What?
Kenilworth.
Rick...?
Lingk.  James Lingk.
Monday.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
I'm not.
What would have elapsed?
When did you write the check?
I don't know.
What's going on here?
I can't regotiate.
Fuckin' asshole.
Fuck the Machine.
Why not?
It means, Dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  And so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Your farewell to the troops?
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
Yes.
You did?
Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
Where are you going?
Three?  I count two.
Three.
John...
Are you alright?
Did you see my present for you?
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
Your friend lives in a fine building.
I saw him with you.
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Is Kay coming?
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that?
Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
I don't want to stay here...
Anyone not in your family, is a stranger.  Believe me, when trouble comes, your country won't take care of you.
That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
I'm not afraid of his words.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
Ready, Frankie.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
We were all upset about that.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
What's that?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
...Who?
We have time.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
The 'patrone' is here.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
Mikey, I hoped...
Will we...be able to get who ordered it out of them?
Where's my brother?
Mike, at three and a half...
It was a boy.
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
He says he doesn't know anything, and I believe him.  Roth played this one beautifully.
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
That plane goes to Miami...
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
It might show.
We've never sent this much with one courier.
Did my brother go back?
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
...and the tape will be running.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Kay.
Sleeping inside me.
Where?
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Who's asking?
You said you were Klingman.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
I like sporting events -- I really enjoy watching them in the afternoon. One of the things I love about this country.  I loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series of 1919...I heard you had some trouble.
The Rosato Brothers have performed services for you in the past; I understand that they are under your protection.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
I deny his every charge.
I do not.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
They feel cheated.
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
Rosato, where's your brother?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Yes.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
What was that?
Thanks, doll.
So what did you think?
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
You liked it too.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
You're sure of that?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
A homo?
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
You did not know?
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
But I didn't do this!
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Good morning.
And your name is --?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
What was wrong?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
Do you mind?
No.
Did you kill anyone?
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
So you had a wife?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
Do you miss it?
The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool?
You first.
Not me.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going.
You're the one who started it.
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
I'm game.  Sure.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
Run for what?
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
Never gave it much thought.
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
I'm very sorry.
Storm's getting worse.
I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
Barnett.  Barnett on the wire.
What won't do?
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
Oh Clayton.
Boone!  You awake?  Eight o'clock.
Fuck off!
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
In a manner of speaking.  I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
So what do I do?
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
More your line.
Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
You must think I'm terrible, Hanna.
I do not think you anything anymore.  Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
I don't mind.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Too warm for a sweater, anyway.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
How are you?
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
A boost. A big boost ...
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
Jesus, man ... What'd you do?
Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip.
I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em...
Get out of here, Ray --
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
What do you mean -- ?
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
Let's get out there. And have them run down every 167 Shelby Mustang in the area ... Find out where they're at.
What for?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
You have my word...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
Your girl works in there ...
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Double-meaning intended, right?
Where you been, anyway?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
It just ain't happening --
Got it ...
What about him?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
What color?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
How are we supposed to--
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
How you know that?
You look good...
No.
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
You boosted a 'Vette? Then where is it?
It looks just like a regular Mustang --
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
You sure you're okay -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
Nah. It's a scratch.
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
What happened to you?
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
He's gonna kill you -- !
You?
What are you doing here?
You hear me?
The era when crime didn't pay --
Having fun, Kip?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
What?
I've missed you, man ...
I know ...
But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Hospital.
Take it back, Freb --
Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans --
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
And here I am...
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
What kind of trouble -- ?
And you got some Italians -- ?
Six or seven...
No way ...
Ready -- ?
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Unlock your button ...
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Woo-woo-wooooo!
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
She does have one thing you don't.
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
Okay, then... Otto?
Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis?
Split it up. Any word on Donny?
He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit.
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
What about me?
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
Not really --
You have any other answers besides "not really"?
What are you doing here, assface?
Which way's out, man -- ?
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Nods again.
I've been all fucked up since I got out.
You think I didn't know what you were doing?
What bag?
The bag with the envelopes.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
We've got to help each other.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
Don't worry with what. You just start looking for a new place. I'm going to Pittsburgh in the morning. The guys from Pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it's only the beginning.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
Where's the stuff?
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
You got money for your bullshit television, don't you?  I gotta watch you swimming back and forth on TV all night long, don't I? You got money for that, but you don't have my money?
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
Don't worry about it.
There are cops all over the place.
What'll I tell Fran?
Watch this.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
How?
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
He's with his friends.
What kind of person doesn't call?
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
What? Come on!
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
Stop brushin' me back!
What do we got?
What'd you get? You get leniency?
Who'd you call?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
What?
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
How'd you know where to find me?
Oh, right.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
Is that true?
Fuck this, let's get something to eat...
Morgan, I'm not goin' to "Kelly's Roast Beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. It's fifteen minutes out of our way. MORGAN What else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
Morgan, Let's go.
Some other guy?
What's up guys?
What'd you say about me?
I'm not sure--
Retainer...
History.
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Seven.
Where is it touching you?
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Yeah, can I help you?
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
That's right.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
--that?--
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
I don't know what it's called.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
What are you smiling at?
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
Yes.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Yeah, cured polio.
How about Gerald Lambeau? Ever heard of him?
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
To show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
Not at all.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
Now wait a minute--
"Undermine?"
--I'm not angry at you--
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I could go for a Whopper.
Well, she out did herself today...
What happened?  You got fired, huh?
I could work the pit maybe, but I could never drive like Dale Ernhart--
Like what, Will?
What places?
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Have you read all these books, Will?
I did.
That must have taken you a long time.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Tell me what you really think.
What does?
What is?
You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
You've never been on a plane.
Why not?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
So Christ, call her up.
Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
My wife's dead.
Hence, the word remarried.
My wife's dead.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
When did you know she was the one?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
They could see that I meant it.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
I guess.
What?
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
You want to read it?
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not...
That's what you want?
What?
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
I kind of got that impression.
What?
So you just want to use me and go?
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Not far from here, South Boston.
How was that?
Yeah.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
I have twelve big brothers.
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
Do you keep in touch with them?
Promise?
'Cause it's nicer than my place.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Want me to take a look?
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Just for fun?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
So, do you play the piano?
Come with me to California.
What do you mean "What am I afraid of?"
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
What am I scared of?
Is that what you think--
What about your twelve brothers?
No, you don't want to hear that.
Will ya look at her!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Don't hold me so tight.
Maybe the road's out.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
What'd he look like again?
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Banana cream, pineapple cream, chocolate cream--and apple.
Want to work?
Kids?
Two.
Can all of you work?
Two and a half cents.
Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
Camp site costs a dollar a week, but you can work it out, carrying garbage, keeping the camp clean--stuff like that.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Say, who runs this place?
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
I ain't gonna run.
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
Can't tell if you hear it or not. You hear it, Tom?
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
But we can still do it, honey.
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
Get to what?
Naw--not much!
Crossin' the desert in a jalopy like this.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
California.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Maybe Connie went to get some books to study up with. He's gonna be a radio expert, ya know. Maybe he figgered to suprise us.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Pa! Shh!
How about it, Ma?
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Ya say we're acrost?
No.
When?
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
I could hide you, Tommy.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
Sure. Good-by.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
Which ones?
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
Tommy?
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Won't they come out here?
Then who *do* we shoot?
I figger best we leave something like this on him, lest somebody dig him up and make out he been kilt.  Lotta times looks like the gov'ment got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Take 'er on down, Al. I'll sign.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
What's these?
Morning.
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
You don't...
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
Computer guy.
Really...? So what?
What am I gonna do?
I want to be an actor.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Jesus...
What's your business?
It's always the little things.
Bad people.
Bad television.
What's that?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
You look beautiful.
...Let me get my coat.
Do you want to get a drink first?
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Like heroin?
He was trying to kill you, right!
Not the other way around...?
Is it something you've done?
You never could have kept this from me.
I'm staying here.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
You don't understand...
You went to school with these people.
You know where I live?
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
What do you want?
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Thank you, no.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
No deal.
Is that right?
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hello, Bob.
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
He using her.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
One cannot love and kill.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
This?
That's going to cost.
They're not happy, sir.
He didn't.
And they want me to make up for it.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
So what happened to you?
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
God it's great to see you.
Debi's house.
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
He sells BMW's?
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
I'm a professional killer.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
You okay?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
When I was first married.
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
You sleeping all right in that house?
I thought you lived in Chicago?
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
He's beautiful.
Poor thing.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
How long did you live here with your wife?
Son?
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Yeah?
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Whatever you want.
Would you like to see that?
How long is this going to go on?
What?
Then why do you want to leave?
You buckled up?  You cold?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
Grace, I don't hate your father.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
What did you say?
What?... Oh baby...
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Why should they?
How's everything?
Good.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Yes. We're suing.
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
No, let me go.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
I love you.
Yeah.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
When are you coming home?
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
Huh-huh. You?
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
About what?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
May I have a suggestion?
Yeah, what?
Yes?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
You want to take a walk with me?
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Where does this go, Diane?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
I'll help you with the coffee.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
I was there for that shot, actually.
They fired you?
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Good luck to you, Annie.
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Of course not.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
She gonna be long?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Are you afraid of anything?
Sure?
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
I thought your mom's coming up?
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
Do you want to go around by the old road?
You want to go down or stay along the river?
"... and I said that"...
Jude, you okay?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
You're looking fit.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
What are you looking at, young man?
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Now that's cool.
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
As you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   Hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Let's keep her.
What's that?
Shh!
Damn!
Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
Oh wow, we are fried.
Well this hasn't happened yet.
Curtis.
And what's he do?
Dead?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Dade?
What are you doing?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
I found it! I found it!
This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
Two days.
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
What the hell is going on?
It has a killer refresh rate.
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
What?
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Oh, wow, she's great.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
There's a new virus in the database.
What's happening?
Mr. Belford?
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
Die, dickweeds!
Joey, Joey...
What? whatwhatwhat?
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
What is he doing in here?
Any questions?
You think they're going to bust us?
Virus?
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
What the hell was that all about?
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
So?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
Thank you.
Hello, operator services.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Real charmer.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
Don't get angry.
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
So?
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
What's going on?
Not without Jamie.
What does that mean?
Get back!
Brady! Come with us.
Get up there Rachel!
Brady! Come with us! Brady!
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Because the lights are all out.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
Four plus Myers.
I do.
Not like 'ol Ben Meeker do something like that.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Sure it is. I think tonight Brady was ready to make a commitment.  But now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because I have to baby sit tonight.
Double scoops?
Hi.
Had enough?
That's all the windows, Dad.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't come on too strong.
Hell of a night.
Do you?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
I am. Ben Meeker.
Why?
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
Something?
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
Thank you.
Jamie! Get away!
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
What time?
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I wasn't spooked.
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Probably Mister Riddle.
What's the pumpkin for?
Thanks.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Yes.
You idiot!
Yeah.
Yeah.
My parents won't be back till ten.
We're all alone, aren't we?
Promise?
What do we do?
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Jesus!
Exactly what do you need?
I found the car! He's here!
It's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, I get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. I'll be totally wiped out!
I thought you were babysitting tonight.
Sure.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Why are they under there?
What about the rest of my comic books?
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
The bogyman!
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Right.
Promise?
Laurie, you come with us...
Yes, she is.
I'm not responsible, Sam.
Of course not.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
What did you use before?
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
Only minimum security.
I couldn't if I tried.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Shouldn't we pick him up?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
Oh, yeah.
That's just --
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Yeah.
Well, I live downtown.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Yeah.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
Like, uh...?
Oh, Elliot!
What are you doing here?
You're out looking here?
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Uh, yes!
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh.
Isn't that beautiful?
Oh!
What are you doing?!
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Aren't they great?
She has all the cooking talent.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
I know.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Was I?
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Are you angry with me?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Get his wine away.
Don't make it worse, Dad.
Why should I be afraid?
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
...or films you must see or... 
Like what?
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
I'm sorry.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
But who?  Where did you meet him?
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh...
N-n-no, not that.
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
But you don't have any symptoms!
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
Yes, please.
No.
Doesn't she look pretty?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
So how are you?
Do you miss Frederick?
How are you?
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Yeah?
Oh!
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
Hey!
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Yeah.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
It's, uh, you never know--
Oh, he's such a loser!
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
You found all this, all this out on one date?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Boy--
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
You're grateful, but you resent me.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
No!
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
I remember you.
It was a terrible evening.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
So how are you?
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
No, I am.  I am.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
You're okay, though, huh?
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
Oh, yeah?  What?
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Hi.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Why are you so upset?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
...<u>please</u>...
Yes?  My <u>promotion</u>...?
You know why that is?  Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights?
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
...you...
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Why me?
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
Who would that be.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
You want to get married...?
I'm not.
And who is "they?"
How crazy is that.
What's new onna street?
I know her by the Back.
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
What's up...?
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
What else did I miss...?
Hold up a minute...
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
<u>Do</u> it...
If you would see him monument, look around you.
I've never heard that he...
What would <u>that</u> be?
What reaction?
He is...?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
Let the girl go.
You seen John Brigham...?
I am all attention.
I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
Waal...
Waited too long, hon...?  
I said how's your baby...?
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
My husband brought it to me from America.
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
Of course, Commendatore...
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
Why did you look at me that way?
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
I'd like to walk home with you, and...
...Franklin.
We got KittyKat...
...who say...?
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I realize, you're under a lot of....
...I'm sorry....?
Thank you, Cordell.
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
You're <u>free</u>...
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
What's that, Baby?
Look what they put her on...
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
What was it.  What was it, honey?
...what...?
Don't shoot yourself.
Why?
"Because we don't have any money."
Hello....?
I know where he is.
I know where he is.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
...what a lovely perfume.
...but:  this particular statue...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
....that's right.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
Yes.
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
For approval.
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
Yes.
...why?
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
My encounter.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
You think you're so...but you're just...
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
Do you realize if the women of America would have just heard what you said...
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Man, she's losing it...
Whew, that wasn't a period. That was an exclamation mark. You know, Hayley, behind every great woman is a great first menstruation anecdote.
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
No, they're not from Wendy.
That would be a No.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
When were you in Niagara Falls?
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
Sorry Veronica.
Don't say that.
So, are you a cheerleader?
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I read this spy crap.
Because you're an idiot.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please?
Heather? Wha...
Is she dead?
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
Don't talk to me like that.
No.
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Killing her won't solve anything.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
Chick-en.
And your worst enemy.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
Did you miss him completely?
We killed them, didn't we?
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
Your son's dead and you love him.
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase....
It's over, J.D.  Over!
Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
Let's kick his ass.
I think so, man.
Shut the fuck up, all right.
How was the funeral?
But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
Come on through.
Look who I've found!
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
But she'll have no one to look after her!
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
Can I go now?
My name is Gina!
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
I'm educating myself!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
hurries over.
That's coming along well!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Mummy!
John has fallen in love with me!
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
But that's not true! I've got one.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Are you a dream too?
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Eighty third most common.
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
I have my connections
GWEN?
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Hello I'm Dr...
Have we met?
I've been in here before.
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Good boy.  Where's is it?
What?
Uh... eighty two?
In a word? Lucrative.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
What evidence?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Thanks.
I don't work here.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
Two.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Are you ready?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
And you pulled people out? You're...  a hero.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
The bathroom!  For two days?
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
You got it?  Four year scholarship to a top college, plus Medical School or Law School or whatever Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to my attorney, plus pay her fee in full, plus my annual consulting fee...
And give a deposition to the jUdge.
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
"Anticipation of incarceration"?
How recently?
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Mister LaPlante...
Mister LaPlante...
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
I didn't even know you had a kid.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
Nothin'.
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
Bill, I...
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
Bill, listen...
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
He waited for you three hours!
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
Me!
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
Uh, er... I...
Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody.  <u>You've</u> known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement.  So you feel like a fraud...
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
Gale...
John, I know all about it.
Did you get it?  Jesus, did I say that?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a cast, you oughtta feature it more it's parta the story.  Network's taking everything we give 'em.  They wanta feed off our six o'clock whether we find the mystery guy or not.  We're very big nationally.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
He lost a shoe!
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
You didn't?
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
You didn't... get it on with him?
What about?
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Give it here, Bernard.
Was that your dad?
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
And the rent is okay?
As long as you keep remembering why.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
No, no, no, no.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
About what?
It's the middle of the night, sweetie.
A man?  Was it a dream?
Why are you mad at each other?
And?
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Whew.
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
Neil, calm down.
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
What?
I know it's at the high end of our range --
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
Did you hear what he said?
What?
Honey, are you okay?
I hear things in this house,
All new houses have noises.
Yeah, I guess it would be good for us to get away for a while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same idea.  Dogs need a change of scene, too, from time to time.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
Did the cleaning woman come?
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
How large is your brood?
What about cable?
Neil, do you mind?
I have a cold.
And I can't help having a cold.
Is it a king or a queen?
Even cosier.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
Lieutenant Bedsoe?
Tough.
This ties in with Nash.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
What?
She was a good woman.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
Yes -- I think it is.
You'll have no need for that, Highlander.
You?
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
What?
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
I hear you.
I'm leaving.
Leaving what?
Maybe myself.
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
You're looking a wee bit green, Thomas.
How long is the voyage?
Living.  Remember?
No.  What am I to do?
That doesn't matter.
Can you really tell from doing that?
Your words are kind and they flatter me -- but I think of her as a sister. Besides, you hardly know me.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Why are you doing this?
Huge.
To talk to you.
A lucky guess.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
If it's good advice.
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
You're hurt.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Because it's my name.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
No.
Yes.
You have an interesting accent. Where are you from?
You're not an easy person to get to know.
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
It came from your great, great, great grandmother, Isabelle Tourez, who lived in Paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  The ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
What now?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
How could they get by him?
We found him this morning.
I like my work.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Impressive -- is it not?  The problem is I can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  I need more power to hold the form longer.  I need the Highlander.  Where is he?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
I am stronger than you, Highlander.
That's what the Kurgan said.
You know it's not safe here for you.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
I'll no forget you.
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
I can take care of myself.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
I guess so.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
You should warn them, Sonny.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
He knows better than that.
I guess not.
Who sent you?
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
That woman's gonna call the cops.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
We're cool.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
Talley?
I'll give you these people.
What?
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Who else is here?
Use more ice.
What about my father?
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Keeps to himself, more like.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
What hospital?
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
I need to work out some stuff.
Mine, too.
You leave that gun alone!
Shh, they'll hear you!
Want one?
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
Whatever.
I can't go without Thomas.
What's going on?
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
That's enough.
That's not enough.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Louise?
She didn't answer.
What's wrong with the radio?
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
You want me to stick around, I could --
It's right in front of us.
Go, Mickey.
It's mine.  Talley.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
Where's the office?
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
What do you want me to do?
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
He has lots of disks.
Who is it?
Did you find the disks?
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Who are you?
Don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. Do you understand?
When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
I guess we do.
Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
How many in your family?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
Excuse me, Colonel.
Will you protect us.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
The police are very busy.
He did.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
Where are my supplies?
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
Whiskey?
I'll be over.
No.
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
I committed no war crimes.
I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
You have no whiskey?
Satellite feed.
The fifth room is your broadcast room.
Good. I'd like to book a massage.
When will they be here?
There are no more rooms.
Mr. Manager.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Yes, sir. What is wrong?
What do you want?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
He will be here.
Our cards, please.
Was there blood?
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
Your brother's here?
What?
No.
I couldn't help.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
Has Roger spoken yet?
This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope.
You could leave, Paul.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
I have to go out to get food.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
Tell me what it was.
What sort of car?
I want to know.
I will not leave without the twins.
We have to have a plan.
What sort of plan?
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
That is why they call it coach?
You have taken business class?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
Thank you, sir.
Yes, thank you Mr. President.
The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
There are soldiers.
We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
So what stopped her?
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Don't think it'll be a problem.
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
Excuse me?
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
What's down there?
If you know where it is, get there!
Pritchett, is that you?
Pritchett!
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Why?
I don't think so...
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
-- you lose either way, Price --
Cheery looking bunch.
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
What --
You okay?
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
You've got your own TV show?
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
Could we have a word?
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
You're hurting me.
Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July.
-- the sadistic prick --
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr.
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
First time for everything.
She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
-- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have --
-- even if I give you a million as well?
I think...I may have the answer.
Sorry.
Good way to get your head blown off.
I was upstairs!
Well, I don't.
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
Rewind that.
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
It works.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
Won't do any good.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
-- I'm coming --
What's the matter?
It might have been her mother.
What will they tell you?
Did you find her?!
May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
Don't play games with me, little girl.
She's down...
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
Look daddy!  It's empty!
Oh my God!  She's in there!
Good night Angel...
Mommy!
What?
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
...set up some more things.
Were you fooling with the power?
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
Oh come on!
She has a...friend.  Colleen.
Do you think I'm a fool?
Maura, what is this!
Not at all.  I'm just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
You've done your homework, Mrs. South.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
It was a shame.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
Now you must listen to me. This force is like a parasite, or a virus. It feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
This isn't happening...
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
What are you getting at!
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Where did you find this?
There's something through that wall!
What do you mean?
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
I know what I saw.
And what is ... this frozen moment?
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
What is it?
Why are you so interested?
What?
I'm trying to quit.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
How have you ... ?
Every day.
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
You're JP Monroe, right?
A prize?  For what?
I'm sorry.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
Not quite.
Yeah really.  I'm ...
You're apologizing?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.
That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
You're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray.
That was beautiful.
The security's actually not that severe.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Eighth room down, babe...
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
Cameras?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
My life is not some deal.  I...
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Hit me with your best shot.
My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
As you know, the Da Vinci Codex, has lived in the Vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more.
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
Prison?
How long were you in?
Catholic girls are scary...
Wha--
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
I hope you know what....
It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
Cat got his tongue?
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
What a pleasant surprise.  You're probably wondering...
Why do you show your parole officer such disrespect? Especially after I got you such a nice job.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Remember that shoe you lost...
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
You certainly do.
Bunny, not you too?
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
Why George, you big softie...
Sharp.
Snappy.
The Hudswinger!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
...You know! For kids!
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...The people look like ants.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
...You son of a --
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
How long've you been down here?
What the heck's she doin', Lou?
This I know, Benny.
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
Yeah, but, buddy --
But, buddy, you were --
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
Nah, that's all forgotten.
But, Buzz --
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Well, why don't ya read it.
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
I haven't had --
...Who let you in?
Well, I made the dean's list.
No, sir.
But --
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
I got gas, Bennie.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
...No money.
Hello, Niagara.
She's got other problems, of course...
Maybe he's wise.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
What's this?
Things so bad, nobody can help -- not even Doctor Maxwell.
That's nonsense, Alma.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
Mrs. Rand.
But you didn't have to come up here.
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
I like her already.
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
But she's not dead, Wes.
It is not beautiful.
Why was the maid crying?
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
I suppose so.  Yes.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
I've no sympathy with people who can't resist temptation.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
She was beautiful.
The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
And what happened then, Mrs. Rand?
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
An accident at the mill?
Dr. Maxwell -- it's nice to see you.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
So early?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
I do. I'm -- are you...?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Don't start.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Well, what kind of faithfulness are you after?
If you're going to insult me --
Elena.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Yeah. Well, we can just --
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
So how's school treating you?
Grades?
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
Birth control.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Fascist!
Nah.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.
A key party?
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Well, we can talk about it.
Sure. Maybe coffee.
With Mikey?
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Social work?
Educated guess.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Where you going?
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
Do what?
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
The Idiot?
Great, thanks for the tip.
Frankie opens them with his teeth.
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
Where you going?
I don't know.
When worlds collide.
You get in trouble?
Hello, Charles.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
And?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Hey Sandy.
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
Just thought I'd stop by.
If it wasn't raining we could take him outside and blow him up.
Well.  It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
Vodka?
One more shot?
I love you.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
Typical seventeen year-old.  She went to a party Friday night?
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
Who's playing?
Then change it.
Not really.
It's legitimate.
I know.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
What I saw?
She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
I'll call him now.
No.
So?
What happened at that signing?
Did she?
That's right.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
You know I remember that.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
Looks like the natives are restless.
I wish I could stick it out like you.  I just, with Trish and the kids...
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
How should I know?...
You don't know.
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
That's what I said.
I don't know.
Who?
She used some stupid code name.
Oh?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
I suppose.
No.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
This an accident, Walter?
Where's your back-up?
Monstrous.
Your lips, they didn't move.
So you have the answers...
That is a picture, nothing more.
Then there is nothing.
Then God does not exist...
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
Claudia is dear to me. My... daughter.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
She is.
I can't save her.
I couldn't prevent it.
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
No.
Your melancholy eyes...
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
What is it now? You irritate me! Your very presence irritates me!
Is that supposed to frighten me?
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
Laudanum!
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
You want me to be a doll forever?
Claudia - don't -
You... fed on me?
You both did it?
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Don't mock, Claudia...
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
Louis, look at me.
And you never cried -
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
Or her, or her - or any of them?
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
What danger?
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
What do you mean?
Then my luck would have changed.
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
Give it to me!!!
You've just done it -
You really want to be with them?
Did I hear a yes?
Come, you're going to feed now.
Take him.
The crucifix -
Dear God, what have I done?
It can't be...
Fascination...
The trick is not to think about it. See that one? The widow St. Clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. She's perfect for you. Go ahead.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
Paris? You came from Paris?
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
What do you imagine you are Louis?
Lestat, she's alive!!!!
The girl, Lestat -
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
She's here, your wounded one.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
I didn't want to kill her.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
You'll come home with me Louis? Fro a little while... until I am myself again.
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
That's all past, Lestat.
Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
You can't look at them...
What about coffins?
You loved your wife, surely.
Shall we go on?
How could I not? She had to know.
No... it can't end like that...
But it has. There is no more to tell.
No...
And the child who did die?
Look at the gaslight. Don't tke your eyes off it. You will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. Do you hear me?
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
I thought you were out of town!
That could break the machine.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
He does work hard.
Oh!
Karla! You promised.
Don't even think about it.
It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too.
Let him go. I believe him.
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
You're okay. Thank god.
I got in early. I was excited...  Who was that guy?
No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just...
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
I don't know.
I'm fine.
I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
To get out of Southport?
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
What? What are you talking about? Where?
Why are you doing this to me?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
I trusted you.
...Why?
You know what I want to do to you ...right now, don't you? There's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
We'll only be a second, okay?
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
You're just talking nonsense.
) You feel the symptoms?
I have not been on the island in twenty years. It is changed - changed completely. Where are the graves -- the coffins?
Perhaps I had better stay. I am tired.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort 
Whet do you mean?
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
How do you know what my father thought - -
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man   working at him   turning him against Thea.
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
Woman, what are you doing here?
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Her family name?
Your daughter is ill.
She's not too well.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Oh, now  now look here 
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
All right  all right.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
What are you, a mind reader or something?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
I told you  I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
It isn't me!
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
What?
Clarence . . .
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
I . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
That's the kid.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
I know. I know.
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Yeah  yeah  hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
Of course it's the place.
Oh  Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right along.
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
Hi, Daddy.
I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Daddy!
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
She's swell.
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Well then, how do you know?
You're not paid to be a canary.
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Aw, get going!
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Maybe you were born older, George.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
It's important.
Hello.
Holy mackerel!
Those Rockefellers!
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Yes, sir.
Have you notified the police?
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
I don't like coconuts.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Well, I don't.
Me?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
How's that?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
No, I don't want to be rude.
Where are we going?  Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
After that, who cares?
Have fun.
Hi.
To keep from being an old maid.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Oh, George, George!
I've eaten.
Oh, Mom  I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
Sure, sure I am.
For me...?
How fast is enough?
Is she responsible for the punch?
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
Yeah.
Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
Want to talk about it?
Tina!
No!  It's still there!
What is it?  What's there?
Aren't you off-duty?
Abandoned?  It's a little early in the season for that.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
In here.
What camera?
If there is, develop it!
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
I can't let you take her out.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
No place special.  Just hanging out.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
You stay here a minute.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
Hey, come on....
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
Did you get any pictures?
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.
What are you all, blind?  It's a shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.
Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
You don't make enough.
As soon as I heard about it, I called you.  This thing is big! His arms indicate big.
The what?
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Do you?
Okay, so that's it.
Sound?
So there's one around here.
Where the hell were you?
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Nothing.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
No.
It was bad, wasn't it.
What?
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
We're alone.
Are you serious?
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
I know, I know....
Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
Now I really want to see it.
Waiting for Andy.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Who'd you ask?
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
What's that mean?
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
And second?
Be careful....
Until we find something.
I'd like to go out to the light- house with you.
I thought you were grounded.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
I don't care.
What's wrong?
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
I don't think she's such hot stuff.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.
You always go with Andy.
I want Fruit Loops!
Maybe.
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.
I think we got a couple of live ones.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
Larry, I'm a businessman, trying to make a buck like anybody else.
So?  So?
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
Hope I make it through both.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
Honey, I gotta go.
And what else is bothering you?
No.
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
Michael, the sub's dead.
And leave me down here???
You would, wouldn't you?  I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
You all right?
Michael...
After what happened to us?
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
No, we'll go through here.
... Mean through the tubes?
Yes.  It's faster.
No,  I'm not going through there.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
So tell Calvin.
So?
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
What do you mean, we don't?
Somebody better get down there!
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
That's right.
Me.
I am.  You're not.
Nobody told me.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
I thought they were clever.
I can have them walk backwards.
Let's hope he knows that.
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
How's sleeping beauty?
Still sleeping.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
I think that you and I are natural enemies.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
He's a young one.
Sure.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
I'm a water-skier.
Sure am.
Yes, it's great!
Come on, it's fun!
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
Watch it, I'm gonna fall.  I'm gonna go!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Yeah, poor bastard.
I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year.  A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
Buzz off.
No, South Georgia.
Polar bears.
Oh...
Five hundred yards.
I'll go with you.
It's not closing, Mike.
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
He taught us good, though, didn't he, Sean?  We were lucky to grow up the way we did.
Who's grown up?
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
That bugger moves fast.
Thea....
But you always let me....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea....
No way....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
Make a list.
Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
My brain is shrinking.  There's only so much room.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
No fair, I'm not armed.
No....
I have work....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
All he did was kiss me....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
Michael!  This thing working?
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
Bang sticks are like yelling at it....
You check it....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
What?
You're damn right I'm serious....
I'm just getting started....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
I'll be all right, Michael.
I'm not going to quit now....
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work....
You're not a pain in the ass....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
There's nothing to worry about....
I don't want to talk about that.
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Why'd you come out here?
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
I don't know why I've told you all this.  I hardly know you.
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
I can't....
Sure you can....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
What?
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I'm sorry...I....
You sure you don't need glasses?
I have coffee in the thermos.
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
You sure you know how to do this.
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
Can't this thing go any faster?
What happened?
I don't know what the hell to say....
Still chasing fish?
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
She's a tough lady....
Feathers all over the place....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Will you leave me alone...?
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
They won't fight with me....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
I don't know shit about electronics....
What's so funny about that?
A Moray eel...A Moray eel....
'Snuck up on me....'
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
You don't like my voice...?
What the hell are you doing?
If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it.  We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio.
Who grows more beautiful....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
What?
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
Mr Blattis, of our local news- paper. You sure it's a suicide?
What about that kid, Ross?
What do you think?
Yeah, he can go ...
Who is who?
How's the new residence?
What time is it?
There's nothing in the files?
You want my advice?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
Where is everyone?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
Why?
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
Jesus. What are you doin?
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
You ain't going in alone?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
No.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
Once.
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
His blind friend got "attacked." Angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
Yes, Sir.
Me?
I'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. I couldn't get out.
Hamlet. Have you read it?
Are you wearing a uniform?
No.
Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
I know.
You know? How do you know?
I know about alcohol, John.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
So tonight she confesses?
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
Well, no you didn't --
Could you just stop moving?
Look, I don't want a --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
There is something missing here.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Oh come on --
Oh no.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Hello?
It's all going to work.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
-- especially one like this.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
Yeah, what happened there.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
What?
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Why do you love me?
Please, if I start talking --
I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
Denver is where he should be.
Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
I got it.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Rod --
No.
Great word.  Towel?
Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
No, I don't know.
The kid is amazing.
You never had The Talk, did you?
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Why not --
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Gorgeous.
To the pools?
Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
You gonna get that --
Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
... dick?
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
One-two-three, swing.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Let's go the zoo.
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
After what you've seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
Her new boyfriend.
Sorry.
What did you say!
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
That one time was just the bumper.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
I don't remember
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you, Paul. He needs us.
He could have died.
We should try fishing again.
You mean it?
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thats where he's headed.
He loves you too.
They never got that big.
We could co-write a paper.
He used to know me.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
Why?
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
Amanda!
How did you know?
Just a little bit too much, I think.
Sorry.  We were saying?
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
You hear something?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
Oh --
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Is that kid still bothering you?
That was about a year ago.
Well, is he?
I could come with you.
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
You've broken its leg!
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
What's he got in there?
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
Our chance to do what?
It has a broken leg!
What do they want?!
No.
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Because it exists.
Somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
But why?
You remember that guy, about twenty years ago, I forget his name, but he climbed Everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead.  And they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
Can you set up?
It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
What?
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
-- way we could safely --
Ruining everything, that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Give it more morphine!
WHAT ARE YOU-
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
What?
The door security systems are shutting down.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
But would we get the phones back?
How would we cut off the lysine?
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Pretty sure.
I have samples all over the kitchen. 
Oh my God.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
Once we have control again we - -
Well, because you're a - - I'm a - -
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - a gizzard - -
Are you sure?
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
You can't hold it by yourself!
Oh my God.  Aw, God.
Why not?
It's all right.
I get ah - -
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
Tim.
Tim, are you okay?
I doubt it.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
So you two dig up dinosaurs?
Cloning from What?!  Loy extraction has never recreated an intact DNA strand!
You got any kids?
Yeah, they hate me.
You want to talk about this?
You're sure?!
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
What kind of opinions?
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Robert.  Robert Muldoon, my game warden from Kenya.  Bit of an alarmist, I'm afraid, But he's dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
Ah - - they're here.
He left us!  He left us!
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Watch how it eats!
Please!
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
Your silence intrigues me.
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
I hate trees!
No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  Stop! Stop!  Don't let the monsters come over here!
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
Jump, Timmy!  It's too late!
That's not true...
You have a map.
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
I don't know...
What about that other guy?
Other guy?
Who?
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Sorry.
Well?
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
So?
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
How do we prove it?
Well, that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes, but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
That's open to debate.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.
Me too. I'm drunk.
Yeah, what is it?
Add it to the list.
How's that possible?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Are you all right?
You work in the insurance department?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
You look like brothers.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Just what you've published.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
A man must eat --  And drink.
-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
Another one?
It's my last and final one.
In an organization as efficient as ours, if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all.
Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann?
Good morning --  Or should I say good afternoon?
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
Was there something else?
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
Well -- nice to know life exists outside the office.
What?
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
Are you free tonight?
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
What of it?
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
They're not obliged to tell.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
You don't believe that.
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
No -- not this time.
-- Listen to me --
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- Gabriela is relevant.  When I spoke to you before I didn't know she'd been seeing Eduard.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
... Why take me into your confidence?
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
... A piece of paper ...
-- You seem amused.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
And I suppose Dr. Murnau didn't die in a cave-in.  You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for your own ends.
What's the matter?
This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
I could always apply there.
You look tired.
Women are all you have on your mind!
We've been together too long.  His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
Oskar!
Hi - Carl Denham. I'm A big admirer of your work, sir. I've loved all your discoveries. I really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. It'll be good for you and good for me.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
Out! Out! All of you! We have been issued with an exclusive permit -
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ...  organize an expedition -
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Man Eater!!!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Hey! I thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
What?
Are you gonna start it up?
Coz of something I lost.
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
So do I.
Well we're pretty --
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
Oh no.
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Honest?
No, I'm look --
Most of them.
-- OK --
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
I go on rounds.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Is there anything more I could --
What're you gonna do next?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Thanks.
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
Arlyn Page.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
What's the matter?
I don't get you.
Ligourin: How could you do it?
Please.
We did this before.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Bree --
How do you know how bad it was?
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
You wanted to, or you are?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
Then, close the case.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
You must be discouraged.
That who?
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
Just send me a money order.
John, how are you?
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
It's in the report.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Has she talked with you since prison?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he got to play with this one, anyway.
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Yes sir, we know he --
Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone?
What do you have here, Billy?
What do you like best about her?
Ladies and gentlemen...
Greatest.
Show.
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
You forgot the milk.
What about my orange juice?
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
Yeah?
Mom, I mean dad...
Uh huh...
C'mon, there's not much difference--
Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay?
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
Salisbury steak.
I hate it.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
I want a pizza.
Then eat around it.
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
I'm sorry...
Daddy?
Uh huh?
Is mom ever coming back?
I don't think so.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite...
Objection.
See.  That's my name.
Wow!
No, she never did.
What did you do when you were little?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Was there apple juice when you were little?
Was there Burger King?
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Daddy!  You're home early.  Did you get fired again?
What don't you understand, pal?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Your mom.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
Six years.
No, I did not.
Did you wish to?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
So do I.
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?
A heavy drinker?
Was he unfaithful?
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
I don't recall.
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
I was not a failure.
You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
You've been living here, in the city?
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
Yeah?
And?
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
Oh, Christ!
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
Oh, no..
Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer?
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Yeah.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
She ever ask about me?
Ted.
We must go, Holiness.
Kham, Holiness.
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector."
I am sorry, Lhamo.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
Here. We'll collect them.
I will buy them for you.
Can I free the prisoners?
We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
I will not approve it.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
General Chiang.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
The Sera monks have surrendered?
Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news. The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China. We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake.
And the United Nations? Surely?
I am afraid.
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
Cow.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
This many?
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
Roughly five thousand men.
No. This war is almost over.
Has anyone died?
One country did sponsor the resolution. A land called "El Salvador".
Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
True.
What does the butter spot feel like?
I have more men.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
You cannot.
We have enemies.
Ahh.
But, I have no experience.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.
It is a difficult situation.
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
Did you love your husband, before you married?
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
You killed him.
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
Thank you.
I might get a shot.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
I'm laying a spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Just spit him back out.  Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
He never said "go".
No way.
Where?  Where?
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
Such the flirt.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
What?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
So I don't like tents, why--
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
Same thing from Fish And Game.
<u>Something's</u> in that water.
I beg your pardon?
It's too dangerous for--
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
You flew up here because your boss--
Good.
Good.  See ya soon.
I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Like little children.  You okay?
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
Well.  Goodnight.
We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
Well...
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
He's floating.  Take it home.
He's mooing.
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
White perch.
Are they feeding?
I can't.  I'll get Hector!!
If you get a safe shot...
He's done.  He's dying.
Is the dead guy in there?
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
This is a little different.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Not yet.
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
What is with this lake?  It looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
They don't believe her.
Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them.  He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped.
You like Jack?
Hector thinks you like him.
Are you okay?
Hank!
That's not what you came to say.
A jerk.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Kelly--
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until--
Wild guess.
<u>You</u>?
You and Kevin.
Kelly--
Myra.
Shitbutt?
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Phone call, Clarice. It's God.
Why does she keep repeating the name?
No. He won't come after me.
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
Hot damn, Clarice.
I don't know! Get me out!!
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Maybe he lives in this, this Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw her every day, and killed her sort of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant to... give her a 7-Up and talk about the choir. But then -
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
Miggs has been murdered.
Murdered...? How?
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
What do you see, Starling?
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
What would it take?
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before.
Sir, that's great news. But how -
Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
Yes sir... I'll do my best.
They said she was just rags, like somebody -
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
I think so.
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Then please - do this test for me.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Who killed your patient?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
They all were.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Killed outright?
How long did you live there?
No.
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
Early. Still dark.
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
But you could. You did.
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Starling.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.
Time, Pilch! My move.
My God, you've grown up.
Let us go, miss.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
What?!
I do not remember them. I was one or two.
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London...
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
There was none!
You do not know what you are saying!
I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
You still have an aversion to the water?
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
"Some"?
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
I see...
Yes. Go ahead.
Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany.  They'll never make a passage north.
We were headed...
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Came across the war party, tracked 'em.
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
Ottawa!
How long?
Then what?
Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward.
And if we're unlucky?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
Easy for you to suppose. While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
Sergeant Major!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Yes.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Yes.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Such as...?
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
They found this?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Be careful with it.
Doc eat already?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
We're getting out of here just in time.
What has?
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
Jesus Christ...
No!
Your suit, Becky!
No.  I'm just being friendly.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
They know, don't they?
How much time does that give us?
We made it!
What's wrong with it?
...I'd really have to show it to you.
No!
Twenty minutes...
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Not yet.
Yes sir...
It...almost got you.
You let him get away!
You guys are crazy.  What the hell you play that stupid game for?
What game, Cobb?...I'm on my way to Nirvana...
Serves his ass right to get it.  Motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
How'd you do that?
The infirmary?...
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
What is it?
What on earth's the matter with you?
What is it?
Are you sure you saw something?
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
How much did you part with?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.
Yes?
You want a pint, go to the pub.
Like what?
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Chris.  You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?
I think I can help you, as it happens.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
Son?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
It's not him, Dad.
All right, Dad.
Sure is.
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
Jesus, I have heard about him.
We gotta get those guns.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?

What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.
Everything all right out there, Tom?
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
You will what?
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
For half a million?
That you, boy?
Go on.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I can't help you, Plank.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these days.
You know how much it is, Nick.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
What's left over?'
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
What are you carrying, Willy?
Er, fertilizer.
We need fertilizer, Winston.
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
Yes, sir--
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Do whatever they tell you--
You're dismissed, Private.
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Private Johnson!
Sergeant?
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
I'm very happy to hear that, Private. Now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for Dr. Innis and I'll be feeling okay, too.
How's business?
That the word on our boy?
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Do I seem jumpy?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Yeah, well--
No. You?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Where'd he get all this?
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Uncle Al--
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
He a Black man or an Indian?
So they stayed in Florida?
They were in the Army. Like your father.
I got a pretty good guess.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
PDA?
He's still pissed off about it.
I have a B average.
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
You lived in the States for a while?
Made some money, came back here--
This place is a gold mine.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
Hey, Mikey--
Mikey--
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
Yeah?
They were using M-1's, yeah--
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
Seriously.
You could take it--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
Black Seminoles?
That's where he fell.
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
That's right.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Mercedes Gonzales Ruiz.
Senora Cruz?
You have somebody else out there?
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
Historic occasion, isn't it?
We don't need a new jail.
That's a matter of interpretation--
When we backed you--
That so?
You go by your old house?
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
We have a murder?
I got an idea what happened.
Hey, Sam.
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
Well, you hire illegals--
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
If you spent a little more time training them--
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
You ever play one of these?
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
I don't think you can take it personally--
And when my father was Sheriff?
What?
You gonna stay out here?
I could name five girls at school who have one just like it--
How come?
Time marches on.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Murdered him?
They've got my Amado.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
Nice-looking kid.
He hates me.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
You don't want to be Sheriff.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Yeah.
So what are we gonna do about this?
How long have you lived here?
Two years.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
Couple months before I was born--
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
We start from scratch--
Yeah--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
They got telephones.
How 'bout you?
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
So when did Buddy leave?
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
You know who it was?
He doesn't need to know all my business.
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
Who?
My life was too weird for her.
That's Butterfield...
Take a look at this.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
I could scoop them out.
I'll tell you.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
Yes...
Yes...
Please... I wasn't there... Ask Pimm.
And you don't ask questions?
Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour?
Harry.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
He's good.
They won't tell you anything.
How did it go today?
That's my business. Harry.
What did you find?
It's okay.
What was that?
Harry?
You can't.
...yes?
Harry?
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.
Tapert's got nothing to do with this.  He came here to get his palm read.
He got up and walked.
Are you finished with me?
So could you walk on water?
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Shit.
What are you, my mother?
Then what do you want?
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
Probably.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
What for?
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
Yeah, I know.
Are you satisfied now?
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
Don't bother.
What's her problem?
The Puritan?
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
For an introduction.
Have you been in?
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
How the fuck do you do that?
So Nix won't come looking for her?
You think I'm an asshole.
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
And you believed him?
Did she know where Nix was buried?
No.
... no...
That's where we're all going.
He did something with the ground.
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
What about Philip Swann?
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
You could still help me do that.
Why would I want to?
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
Bob, it's me.
What are you doing here?
Try twenty-five.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Not really. How long are you here for?
Charlotte, who?
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Really?
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
We established that we have no communication.
It's for my daughter.
Four.
Where's your husband?
Do you know where we are?
You're leaving right now?
Mr. Harris?
Yes?
Yes?
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
What?
It's ok.
What?
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Excuse me?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
You wanna come?
Are you sure you want to stay?
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Uh..thanks.
You never said anything to me...
Bad?
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Hmmm.
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order.  What a nightmare.
Yeah, like...
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
Claire...
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
No, I wasn't, actually.
But your patient is legally entitled to it.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
He will.  He has great faith.
Is he going to be okay?
What is it?
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Father, I'm right here.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
You just call?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
And also that...
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
What's that got to do with you?
I do.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
You should think about getting professional help.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
Do you know your parents' blood types?
Get up!!
Peter, let go of the chair!
You okay?
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
What's the bible for?
Maybe that's my problem.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
What about after?
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
What did he say to you in French?
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
And what are you thinking we should do now?
A lot of good that'll do.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
He can see you Thursday.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
Good of you to stop by.
What do you mean by that?
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Would you sign it for me?
Mike.  Oh, the christening.  I meant to call...
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
What happened?
Nothing.
Ah, Mom.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
nothing.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
I can't eat before a game.
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
How is he?
To that stewardess?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
Don't curse.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Are you okay?
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
You're a caterer?
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
Coach...
Can I take your coat?
I'm an English major.  You like English?
Huh?
It's okay.
So how long is this trip?
That too tight?
Mom's going to hate it.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
No one's forcing her.
Yeah, right.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
You shoot like a girl.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
Just one word of advice for next season.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
I just can.
I never knew a girl that could play.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
He works at a bank.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
For how long?
So?
I don't have to do what you say.
What?
Way to hoop.
I know this.  What do you want?
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
What's that?
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
That's it, give it your best shot.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
I don't.
Why?
When'd you get this?
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
You do see me standing here, right?
That was so weak.
Kiss my booty.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Hey.
What's up?
Hey.
We're going to get some food.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
You forgot to be there.
Stay!
Never had to.
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Just something I'm trying.
Yup.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
Funny.  I never did.
Tried calling you a couple times.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
What do you mean?
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
What's going on?
you woke me up to tell me that?
I heard enough.
Then why are you so upset?
For what?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
Hey, girl.
No.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
At one in the morning?
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
What's that, not great?
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
Uh, your earring?
You scared me.
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
What people?
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
What mess?
Tell me what?
From your mouth.
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
After five years.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
You want me to fuck off?
Yeah.
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Well can you connect me to someone else?
Well what's the situation?
Brain and Lung.
Oh, she's fine.
Oh that's good.
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
...what the fuck is this...?
What do you want? Why are you here?
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I don't wanna talk to you.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
baby, please, please --
Please put your clothes on, please --
...Hello...?
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
No.
You don't have a boyfriend?
You mind if I check things back here?
You take cream or sugar?
-- is not my boyfriend.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
If you're not here for a 422 --
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Billingsley's?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
You really use strong language.
Well.
Can I tell you something?
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
What?
That was so great what you just said.
You don't know how crazy I am.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
What?
Yes.
Claudia.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
-- what kind?
Sure, why?
I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments?
I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
C'mon guys, settle down --
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
-- no.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY.
Son, please, now....
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
How much you pay me for my help?
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
Ok. Listen. You: c'mere.
I'm a rapper.
I'm almost done.
I was listening --
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
This sounds threatening.
Do you have love in your heart?
....do you know who I am?
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow.
Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
Braces?
Yes.
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Do you wanna sit down?
How's today then?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
No.
She loves you.
Jack.
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
...Lily...?
Twelve.
Hello?
I think you have the wrong number.
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
Is that still lingering?
Yes.
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
What am I doing?
Yeah.
Time's up.  Thank you for the interview.
Where are you from originally?
Hollywood, mainly.
Why does that sound silly?
She's retired.
Psychology major?
Do you have your masters?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
...are you Phil...?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
Uh. huh.
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
...ok...
I don't think, he can't...
What? What? What now?
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You can't just come in here.
Calm down.
There's no disturbance.
There's no disturbance.
I don't have to answer your questions.
No one else in here?
No.  I said that.
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
No I Said.
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
I preffer to stand.
I didn't do anything.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Yes I can, Marcie.  And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.
Been drinkin' today?
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
What the hell is this Marcie?
Did your wife find out?
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
Will you say my name?
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
Rose is on the phone and here's the cards for today --
I'm sorry.
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
Willa Cather.
Come home soon after the show.
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
It'll take the pain away.
How do we do this, then?
I'm a bad person.
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
Will that help?
Was there anyone that I know?
Yes.
That's it.
How long with Ellen?
How long with Paula?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
I really don't know.
She's asleep.
Yes.  What's your name?
Was it a call back?
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
No.
You don't want any water?
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
Shut the fuck up.
What are you doing?
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't have regular classes anymore.
What do you do?
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
We need more dog food --
You coulda been in front --
Go to it, handsome.
I didn't know the answer --
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
..sorry...
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
I understand you saved my son's life today.
God smiled upon us.
No, M'lady.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
Mother -- ?
May I speak with you?  Alone?
I am preparing for a ball!
What is it, mother?
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
He is your brother!
No, Louis!  No!
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
How can I serve you in this?
How goes that favor I asked of you?
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
What do you propose to do?
What are they doing?
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
Those can be adopted --
More wine!!
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
But -- what is Porthos doing?
Now.  You were saying?
But -- what is he doing?
We must stop him!
The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected.  Do you notice?
What you're asking is impossible!
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
No!  Stop --
You can't do it.
Everyone back.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
There are more important things than tits.
Mother of God!
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
And why are you so glum?
I don't understand.  What does this have to do with...?  You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but --
But why?
What use am I?
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
D'Artagnan, unready?
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
D'Artagnan!
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I know.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
Where are you going?
Athos!  I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself.
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
What is its antidote?
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
How did you know -- ?
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Phillippe...?
Your Majesty...
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
I decided it this morning.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
I was told this impostor was dead!
Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you.  To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do.  It is against the laws of God, and of France.
Forgive?!
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
Phillippe!
You dead yet?
What number, on the first page?
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
Sire, I --
Sire!  I -- How did you --
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
You would do that, your Majesty?
Captain Doyle?
What can I do for you?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
We're by Ozone...
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
What did the six-toes have to say?
What's this?
What?
Did you start out area six?
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
So...  to get the car back, you break into her house.
Are you alright?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Did he harm the girl?
And what did he do to the girl?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
What?  Wait a minute -
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Who is it?
Where is he?!!
So where are you from?
No...
You always carry a gun with you?
No.
What's going on here?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
What exactly did you see?
Six months ago, a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note, you may have heard of it...
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
What happened with the tape?
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Yeah.
No...I'm in some trouble...
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
Ahh, shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
I'm not going anywhere!
You must be going somewhere.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Are you a regular there?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Where am I going?
Where is he?
That was Peterson upstairs.
I wouldn't presume to try.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
What have we missed?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
Not the Bible?
Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
Will Graham, Jack Crawford...
I have to.
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
You said the guy down here is good.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
What do you want to do?
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
For Christ's sake, why?
Who did he ask for?
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
I'll pick you up in...
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
He's a very shy boy...
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
It's the guard in the storeroom.
He went to the men's room.
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code.  It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do?
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
I'll get my purse.
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
Reba...
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
Are you okay...?
I'll see you later. All right?
It's me.
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
No.
Was I in an accident?
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Do you see?
Mrs. Leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. Do you see?
Freddie Lounds. Your photograph. Do you see?
Oh, God.
Please, no.
You did very well.  I apologize for the crude images.  Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights.
Come in.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
In a holding cell.
Hi, Linda. ..
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Do you know something about that?
Why do you think I called?
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
I don't want to do that,
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
What about the dog?
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
We have it good, don't we?
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Then why?
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Is Crawford going with you?
I want to see you, too.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Let's forget who said what to whom...
You going back down to Florida after?
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
What do you want?
Yes. Who are you?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
I figured I'd ask you...
...after a while.
Yes.
In the papers. I don't tear out the articles.  I wouldn't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid. You want to know how he's choosing them, don't you?
Why should I tell you?
Then how did you catch me, Will?
Do you have the file with you
Yes.
Let me have them, and I might consider it.
Do you dream much, Will?
That's interesting.
I don't have one right now.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
I hope you have a second chance...
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
You have to do it.
Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.  But I have a few terms.
Are you makin' fun of me --?  This is RIDICULOUS!
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
Andy!
How long would they let me sleep?
I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony.
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
What was that all about?
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Tony Clifton.
My hair is coming out.
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Twenty!
Cue the commercial!
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those goodies!
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Popcorn?
No thanks.
Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.
Why Memphis?
And all this will be for real?
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
Have you told your family?
You're NOT DYING!
I'm not comfortable with the last sketch.  I DON'T do drug humor!
You're not listening to me --
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
What?!?
It's so dirty.
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
"Philosophically"?
Are you sure?
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
It's probably just a strained muscle.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
It's my name.
A -- a tourist.
Then the informant is real.
You don't know.
Hurry!
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
What?
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
Do you?
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Did you hear that?
Do you always look at it encoded?
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
How many were there?
What happened to them?
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
Are they any agent?
Yes.
Give me your phone.
Morpheus...
Right now?
Holy fucking shit!
What the fuck do they want with me?!
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
But what if...?
No way, no way, this is crazy.
Do you still want to meet?
You could say that.
No.
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
You -- you're too fast.
I thought it wasn't real.
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
Do you understand, Neo?
Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable.  But now I believe that is going to change.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
Set down in there.
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
What do you believe in?
Morpheus, I don't know --
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
How is he?
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
I'm not the One.
What?
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
What?
Of what?
Who is?
Get this thing out of me!
What?
But an Oracle can.
Are you all right?
How much like it?  Was it the same cat?
That I would have to make a choice...
You can't!
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
No, you're not.
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  Born free.  Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion.
How much time?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Which way?  Which way?
It's locked.
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
What the hell just happened?
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Riverdale.
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
Where to?
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
So?
Yeah.
Panther!  Same thing...
Nah.
There won't be any this week.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
I don't like loading crates.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
That's not going to help.
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Don't you move!!!
I think we should see your uncle.
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
That bad, huh?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
I don't know that.  That's what I'm telling you.
Disgraceful.
Out!!!!
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
You kiddin.  The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
I know.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
You're right uncle.  I must have gotten it confused with something else.
Take a drink!
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
Nothing.
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
"Francis Macomber."
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
Please take it.
See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
What is it now?
Bore.
A paper on that one too?
Take your time.  I don't care.
Sure...He lives there?
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
You know why...with my parents.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Scumbag--
Hey Johnny, where're you goin'?
Sal!... fourteen street.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Hey... you got stereo.
I know...I know.
Well...no.
You could say that.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?
I know what you're going to say but don't say it.  These drinks are all on the tab.  I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise.  I give you my word.
Must have been all the liquor in him.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Can you spare it?
Yeah.
He's coming.
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
That was 'Joe'.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
And you could care less --
What is this?
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Honey --!
But what?
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
...See you tomorrow night.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
What an odd pairing.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
I'm all excited --
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
Yeah, something he goes by --
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
No.
That's it?
Don't you want to hear the details?
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
And what do I get?
Yeah, that's what he said.
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
He was interested.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
'It's up to Joe'?
I'm going to put a stop to this!
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Doctor lady make it irey.
What?
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
I didn't know that.
Do I?  I'm a little confused.
Love.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
What do you mean 'free'?
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
I haven't.
Do you love Drew?
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Susan?
Yes?
Whatever you do.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
I mean I appreciate that.
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
Why?
No.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry about --
He's taking a nap.
...No.
Did you like making love to me?
I loved it.
I love you in an evening gown.
It gets worse.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
That's it?
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Good morning.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Bill --
Yes?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
Make an exception?
There's one to every rule.
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Excellent.  What is it?
And more.
You were just curious?
You tell me, Bill.
'Fish'?
I'll be the judge of that.
I'm her father!
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
You're violating the laws of the universe.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Yes?
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
You are?
Thanks.
What the hell do you care?
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
I don't expect you to.
Are you threatening me?
I told you to shut up.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Happy Birthday, Bill.
Yes.
Death!
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
I think you know --
Are you giving me orders?
I'm sorry, I --
Where are you?  Are you there?
I want to have a look around before I take you.
I'm sorry --
How're you doing--?
I'm doing great.  You ready?
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?
This one.
You think Drew will go for it?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
You like him, don't you?
I don't like to interfere.
You're only six-five once.
...There's a start for a meeting.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
You're not listening --
Aw, you're tough.
Thank God.
What?!
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
That was wonderful.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Raise away.
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
Then what will you say?
Where's Joe?
This is crazy --
But what?
You and 'Honey'?
I agree --
Why?
No, it was so right it scares me.
21.
78.
You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are.
47.
66.
Slam it?
You don't know?
That's the thing. I have this condition.
I have no memory.
My wife.
What makes you think he's my friend?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
This isn't my room?
Why?
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
That's right I did, didn't I?
What?
Who did this to you?
I like your car.
Interested in buying one?
Jimmy?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Why?
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
You know him?
Tell me about her again.
Don't remember.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Did you?
There are things you know for sure.
Your wife?
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
And what did he say?
Where is he?
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
Yeah, I hated it.
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
How?
What?
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
On the house.
Dying.
What do you want?
Well, that's me.
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Shut it, Teddy.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
She has no idea who I am.
Happy now?
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
You're not coming?
What's wrong?
I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
You probably.							 *
Why would I do that?						    *
Your name's Teddy.
What was it for?							   *
Sal Maguda.
With Sonny.  110%.
Yeah?
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
What's "nothing"?
Where's that?
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
Mojitas...?
Zero risk.
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Really?
When?
Would you find me...?
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
No part of it wasn't real.
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
So?
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Where?
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
No.
Chill out Sonny.
Go ahead.
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Alonzo...!
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
What flowers?
What's it say?
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
And...?
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
That sonofabitch!
You set this up!
You're hoping to get a look at what?
Men, they mostly faggots.
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
Look at yourself, Joe, no offense, but frankly, you're beginning to smell. For a stud in this town that's a handicap.
Yeah, well, so?
What of?
No doctors. No, sir. Not me. Doctors are like goddam auto mechanics. Fix one-thing, unplug another. Operate for piles and while they're there, they unscrew your liver. My old man, for God's sake, wasn't any sicker'n I am when he went to the doctor.
They gotta be.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
Listen, I gotta have money.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
You got it.
... and taxi fare for me.
Get lost.
Getchmis...?
'Figgers.
Yeah.
History, man, history. How much?
Twenty months?
Tunnel?
What?
Who?
DAD!
You know where they are?
How far?
About ten kilometers.
Sixty Lira?
I'll pay extra
Where are the minefields?
Yes...?
Just what?
Girlfriend?
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one.
Feeling all right?
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
Hello, Billy.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
Yeah!
You know where it is?
What?
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Max - where?
What?
I think I've been poisoned.
You can't take anything seriously.
Billy, what's the matter?
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
Mr. Yesil.
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
You all watch your step.  We got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  You fall, I don't wanna have to come pick you up.
There's really people living down here?
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
The Department of Public Health...
Any luck?
You feel anything?
A mistake.
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
What are you putting that crap on me for?
Which way?
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
Manny...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
No, Jesus, no.
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
What-
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Hello.
What?
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
I don't have a title yet.
What's it about?
Nothing.
They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I guess that means it's okay.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
The Sistine Chapel?
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
Done?
Well, I hope you like it.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
I DIDN'T...
Perfect.
Show me the way?
You want me to burn my book?
Then light the match, Paul.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
I don't know.
See, isn't this nice?
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
Misery's Return?
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
And I got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker--on account of it's missing an "n." I told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
No, just the paper will be fine.
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
--cliff-hangers--
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
What?
I hope you like it.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one.  Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery?
Annie, what is it?
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
You really think Sheldon's out there?
Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek.  Any calls?
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
Yes.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Marcia, please.
I thought you'd be thrilled. You're being taken seriously.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down.  Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.
I thought you were going to dinner.
See anything you like?
To win?
You picked another winner!
Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
Feel like pleading for your life?
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
Outrageous.  I won't let you take control of my company.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
What was the top bid?
Not exactly.  Wallis?
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
Exactly where is she?
Range is two kay.
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
Do you know me?
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Uh-huh.
What are you doing here?
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
I need your help and I thin you can use mine.
Awfully short notice..
When they've got your recruiting technique?  Not a thing.
They've got a book for this?
They've got a book for everything.
Which is?
So where did I got right?
Five, six-hundred thousand.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
You can be a thief and have a conscience.
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Before you are.
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Yes?
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
-- his left jacket pocket.
I want you out of Australia!  ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it.
Are you okay?
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
No.  Should I?
Why did you phrase it like that?
Twice.
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
She's got no training for this kind of thing.
I don't think I can get her to do it.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
I do.
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Left jacket pocket confirmed.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
Only four more cars.
Whats Hunt doing on the TGV?
This is bullshit - we dont even know what Max looks like.
Two minutes til Krieger shows.  Thisll have to be quicker than Id like. Certainly quicker than youd like.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
I don't think you're in any position to give orders, do you?  Not while I'm holding this.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Max made a deal with you?
You're sure about this?
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Ethans right behind me.  Listen to me Jim.  Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money.  Ethan takes the blame.  No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.
Claire.
This is Kittridge.
Theyre dead.
Dont <u>think</u>, be <u>sure</u>.  Are you clean?
Youre in Prague?
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
And I get to keep the equipment when we're done.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
You really liked Phelps, didn't you?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
It's quite out of the question.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Why, may I ask?
What was your deal with Job?
How will you make sure Job will be there?
How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days?  It's been a delight.  Now where can I drop you dear boy?
What about Job?
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Claire.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Im coming to you.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Why?
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
You're going to use Walter?
He won't be back in a hurry?
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
Yeah.
What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Ill call you from Paris.
Arent you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
Jim, its over.
Of course I can hear you.
I don't know.
Jack...that's spying.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
I don't like him.
I have no money!
I won't pay for nothing.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Okay.
And go to confession.
You haven't said anything.
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
Here.  Ti amo. 
Ti amo.
What's your news?
I'm getting married.
Again?
In a month.
I didn't give you away the first time.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
What'd you do to your hair?
What are you doing here?
Who is this man? You're engaged!
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs.
Have you come from my brother?
Why?
I have no life.
I know that. I do what I want.
I don't know.
No.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
Seven years ago.
Stupid yourself.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
You don't know nothing about it.
What are you doing!
I'm telling you your life!
Because I have no Luck!
Son of a bitch!
Where are you taking me?
What?
She didn't like me.
What did I do?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
I can't!
I'll come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
For what?
They get some turnout for this stuff.
Awful?
What's the matter?
You're making me feel guilty again.
That's right.
This is where we're going!
Why not?
No.
I'm freezing to death.
You've gotta get outta here.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
No?
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
Have Something.
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
On the floor?
I like this ring.
What time is it?
Seven-thirty.
Alright. A month. In a month.
Who is he?
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
Have you told her we're getting married?
We should talk alone.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Are you drunk?
She recovered.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
I... a... slept with my fianc's brother.
I know.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
Moving in?
Where is she?
But why would a man need more than one woman?
That's it! That's the reason!
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
May I presume to ask you a question?
I'm not disturbed. By you.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
May I walk with you a ways?
Yes.
People home.
My God, it's a mansion!
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
Rita. Rita.
Oh.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Cosmo.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
She's got it.
How do you know she is a witch?
You're using coconuts!
Not at all.  They could be carried.
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
Am I right?
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
I am your king!
Of course.
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
You said it again!
What?
Come on then.
Come Here.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Bedevere, my Liege.
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
There!  Look!
What?
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
Greetings King Arthur.
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
What?
Well ... I AM king.
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
... But all the decision of that officer ...
... but a two-thirds majority ...
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your favorite colour?
That's easy!
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
To seek the Grail!
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to...
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
But, Mother ...
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
How?
Leaving the room ... yes.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
Okay.  Fine.  We'll remain here until you get back.
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Camelot ...
Sir Galahad!
Well, she's got a point.
We'll cover your escape!
No.  It's unhealthy.
Sir Gawain.
Back to your bed!  At once!
Well ... yes ...
I'm ... er ... Sir Launcelot, sir.
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
I done it again.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
What?
Which one of us is she flirting with?
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter.  To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R.  Best friend!
What's this?
It's a diary.
I can't move to tidy.
Mary Taylor, sir.
Checked and locked, sir.
Checked and locked, sir.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Yeah.
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
Of course.
I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water.  She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble.
It's the Queen's decision.
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
What did you say?
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
By whose authority?
We --
Who'll bring it to me?
I need a man who knows where I am.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Awaiting my orders.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
It's nothing.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
I wouldn't know.
Maybe, once.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
I do what I do.
For Her Majesty.
Aye.
They don't see it.
The greasy pole.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
Mr Brown.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
What are those?
What?
Those, over there, there.
Are they worth reading?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Yes, ma'am.
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Then why send me back to them?!
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction.  She's never been less popular.
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
Erysipelas.
Yes.
Why was I not informed?
What is he doing there?
I understand he was in a fight.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Read it.
Again?
Who told them that?
I have a letter, ma'am.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Then why are you not with him?
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics?
But how can it change every time?
He?
Now what seems to be the problem?
What's her problem?
Did you play ARCADE last night?
I came from the city on the left.
Yeah...
Nick...
I have to talk to you.
It turned itself back on, Nick.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?
No way.
What?
Maybe it is alive in a way...some sort of electronic intelligence.  It's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something.  It's self-replicating...it mimics life.
It's already out.
Then where do we go?!
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
Alex...
Put in a quarter.
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
The clock's already ticking.
So how did you do it, Alex?
Then we'll go home?
What did he do to you?
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point.  What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy.
"Escape"?
Cool.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
I'm going home Cynthia.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
You're broke!
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
I'll speak to someone.
Beautiful night.
A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
I agree with what you said...truly.
What did I say?
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
Hi.
No, no, I'm fine.
Number 17.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
No.... I don't...
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Strange to be calling yourself.
I'm not sure about this.
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
What is it? What do you see?!
Nothing... I don't like being out in the open like this.
This Denny's.
I had a dream about this place.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
Palmdale.
Not here...no thanks.
No.  I haven't seen any.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
Leave him, he's dead.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
Now where do we go ?
There's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air. It won't kill you, but it will hurt.
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Do you have something better to talk about ?
He hired you to build this place ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
If we can get to through the next room, we'll be at a junction for a power grid.
This is cute.
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Do you know where you're going ?
I work here, remember ?
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
That's nice.  I think I lost my wallet.
It's fine thanks.
That's not to tough.
Hey, try swimming. It works.
You okay ?
Is it over ?
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
What ?
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
I've been working with you for four years, don't you think that's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
He probably has a history of this shit.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Excuse me, sir ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
How long till the drug wears off ?
We should have another fifteen minutes at least.
Look ! Look !
<<belch>>
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
Thank you very much.
Just look at this tie. You could fry an egg off that orange, yow. Have you ever considered the Jerry Garcia line of ties ?
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're...
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Hi. I brought some wine.
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
Hey... did we uhm, you know....
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Hey buddy. You okay ?
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
No.
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
Umm, where do you want this?
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
What about giving the other guy a break.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
It's too bad about your mom. At least she went peacefully, I've seen a lot of people go out the hard way.
What do you remember about her.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
You want me to move?
Okay, no problem.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Was it a nice funeral?
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
What??
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
I love you too sweetie, bye.
She just had a baby that's all.
Can I see him?
Never heard of him. 
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Thanks.
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Oh.  Ohhh?
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
I told you it was a long story.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Special effects?
She's beautiful.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
oh.
Hi.
That's okay.
It's just a corpse.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
So she had you in jail, in Russia?
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
Hi.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
Hi there...can I help you?
My mother.
Your mother?
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
Thanks....
He said it was a gift.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
WHAT??
And I thought I was weird.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Give it to me!
Just come and get it...right here!
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
...I dropped it.
Where are you going???
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
Nick?
Some sacrifices are worth it.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
Ten bucks.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
But...are you engaged or something?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
This is it I guess.
I should do this myself.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Phil for God sake.
Hi!
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
You know how I feel about you.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
You're Nick's mother?
Bye Aunt Rose.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Sort of?
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
What do you mean?
Shelly?
Hey! Oh look.
He is?
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
WHAT?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
The boss is watching us...
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Ex...ex, ex...
You are perfectly healthy.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
What Hurts Vada?
I think it's still available.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
Stiffs??
Excuse me, what about the job?
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
What do you mean??
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Does it make it easier to win?
Kinda like men.
Oh, how do you mean?
Home sweet home.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
Did she ever see Vada?
Do you want to?
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
How's it going chef?
Can we see it from the back yard?
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Vada, we're trying to work here.
VADA!
The money?
Why?
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
When??
I like the freak show.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
Hi Vada.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
I found this.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
What was my mama like?
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
This is one big house for one single person.
How much does it cost?
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
I paid the money.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Oh, Vada...
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
Probably.
Really?
My ball, I lost my ball.
Hi.
Did you read ALL these books?
No, I'm divorced.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Have you ever tried any?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm hemorrhaging.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
It's okay sweetheart.
Thomas J?
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Uh huh.
Oh great!
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Oh no!  UUH.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Naah, I don't wanna.
If I do it, can we go?
Your lip bleeding?
Hey look at this!
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
No, I don't wanna.
What?
Yes.
Who's that with your Dad?
It's my mother.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
What do you think it's like?
Sorry.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
You're right, let's knock it down.
Come on, let's go.
Get up!?
Why are you running away?
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
Then go home, baby.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Like they do on TV?
But, I don't know how.
Okay, okay.
Okay, seeya.  Vada?
What?
I should look different.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
What?
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
He can't do that to me!
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
I noticed.  I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
And you believe that.
The man you love.
Ben Gay.
Elmer's Glue?
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
Two words.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
Needing.
Well, we're...
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
But he sure can kiss.
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
I was gonna predict that.
I mean, he loves his job.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Exactly what?
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
... look good on Kimberly.
Ex-cuse me?
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
I've been calling for days!
What's the sec...
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
She finds him "personable."
Don't you throw up on boat?
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
This thing means that much to y...
Michael? What ha...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Michael...
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
And your point?
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
Fine.  I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Hi! Star.
You're from out of town?
No.
I called Connie and she said not to worry, She'll fill in for you.
What's wrong honey.
Oh, Barnett, I'm so sorry.
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.
What's wrong with her.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
He knows better.
Whose word?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
Well, how about the shopping center?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Come on. He's a crook.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
She sure sings nice.
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
Did you see who that was?
All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
What's this?
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
You got a place to stay?
I don't know his first name.
Bet the sheets are grey.
I don't think so.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
About three years.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
Yes. Who's this?
Tom. You remember?
I don't know who you are.
What?
I have to go.
Wrong.
I have to go. He sighs.
I knew when I first met you.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.
Fifteen minutes?
You know who that is?
Yea.
Hello.
Linnea?
Yes.
Can you make a rehearsal in the morning...?  Courtland wants to...
I can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh?
Did it break?
Do you study at all?
Come on back to bed.
Come on.
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
Why?
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
Got me an audition tonight.
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
I see.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
What kind of pies do you have?
Which do you recommend?
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Yeah.
Hasn't it?
Who is we?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Lobotomy Bay?
Who's the song bird?
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
You guys stay on your bellies.
Do you have a back up.
Yours.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
How 'bout Manson?
Manson beat you.
Not to anybody. She sings.
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
I could go for a Coke.
Sure.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
Just wait one fucking minute.
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Yeah baby.
Yes.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
And they made the first move?
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
Just for fun, I guess.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
That's my opinion.
How immediate is immediately?
You can't be serious?
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
What's the travelling arrangements?
Are you all set?
How's it working, Scotty?
How so?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
How 'bout that furniture plant?
They done that too long in my family.
Who's going to buy me a beer?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
Fill her up?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
Okay.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Guess I don't.
Have anything in mind?
How 'you doin' man?
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
You working?
Oh yeah?
Your folks live there?
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
No thanks.
They must work on the section gang.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
Not here, Duff.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Goin' to see my kid.
Are you married?
You didn't answer my question.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Uh-huh. Why?
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
What about your boy?
Don't, Duff.
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
Day work.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Duff--
We was just leavin', fellows.
What 'you signifyin'?
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
'You Will Anderson?
What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
I heard you.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Take it easy, Pop.
Want me to hold the light for you?
She don't look no worse to me.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Come back some other time, will you?
Well, what're you going to do?
Hell, I'm just like him.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
It ain't in me.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
So I been told.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Well, I got married to one of them.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
I understand.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Shut up, Will.
Now you stay put!
I ain't drunk, honey.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
What you lookin' for, mon?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
You ran without us.
The words?
Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
She's ready to go.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then, last September... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
We got problems topside.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
How's the ice?
What about the route to the core?
What about the mainframe's access code?
Want to fucking answer them?
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
How soon is soon enough?
I'm going in.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
...And if I guess wrong?
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Yes, it's lame.
Remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Roger in Op/Ed.
Who told!
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Anita!
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
Anita, remember espadrilles?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Anita!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Wings?
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
Transitioned?
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
A flack jacket.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Have you been there?
Gus?
What if I say no?
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
It was a long time ago -
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
Is that true?
I-
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Sure, why?
Hey, Josie, hold on.  You've been hiding something from me.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
This seat taken?
Are you--scared?
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Oh--yikes!
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
You ruined the whole thing!
Are you having fun?
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
Not at all!
Yes.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
If you went away, what would become of me?
Taste it.
Taste it.
Why not?
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.
Help me with this thing!
It's not the gas, Dad!
What are you talking about?
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there! Stop him!
You two got a thing going, or what?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
You know her?
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
So, you feeling anything?
I feel like a jerk.
About not finding any bogey men?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Jesse, God - what happened?
Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
Who, Jesse?
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Hi.
Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.
So, school going alright?
Okay, I guess.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Did she always have nightmares?
I'm serious.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Hi Mom.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
Kristen, don't start with me.  You know what your shrink said...
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
What?
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
You like gymnastics?
You did it the other night.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
So?
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
What are these, beauty marks?
A little basic, but nice.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
Oh God.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
With Hypnocyl?
That's right.
To who?
Doesn't matter.
The truth.
Take us there, Kristen.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
Your dreams?
Who is he?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
In there.  Charlie Penny owns the place. We knew no one would ever find it.  I'm not even sure I can find it again.
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
That's enough, Kincaid.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
I'm in.
Lovely to meet you.
God, that's an enormous arse.
I'm not listening.
And then I... right.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
I'm an actress.
No.
Really, no.
I forgot my bag.
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
Busy tomorrow?
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Nothing.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
Why?
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
You've got big feet.
No.  What's that?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
You have a stunt bottom?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
You and every person in this country.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Can I stay a bit longer?
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
I don't know what happened.
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
I haven't decided.
Can I have your autograph?
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Is that right?
He's bringing a girl?
Does the girl have a name?
Yes.
The movie star?
Yup.
Bella -- this is Anna.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
No -- it's my 22nd.
By the way -- it's you.
Ahm... room service.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
What's your name?
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Mr. Thacker?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Topol.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
I suppose so.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Well?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Oh God no.
Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
So -- any messages?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Right.  No one else?
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
No -- you're right.
Why not?
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Which floor?
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
Yes.
Bad news.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
And yet you suspect her.
Yes, that is correct.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Y-y-y-yes...
Get up, Billy.
N-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh...
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Yes, ma'am.
Just that I'm glad to be here, Miss Ratched. I really am.
I wanna report a robbery!
Oh, I had them removed.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Miss Ratched, would you please save a space for my aunt? She's comin' down from Portland.
Please see to Mister Bromden.
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
That's okay, kid...
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
H-Hey, M-Mack.
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Ha! Did ya see that!  Hey, Cheswick!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
There they are!
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
It's the questions she asks.
What? What?
Neither do I...
Miss Ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
Electro-Shock Therapy, my friend. Five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
Tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
What's the use! Hooee! It'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
Time in!  Hold it! Time out!  I said Harding out!
I don't trust you!
Don't you have any clubs?
Big king, too bad...
Who told you that?
Yeah, buddy?
Bet a nickel!
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Gimme the ball!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Is that so?
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
In what way?
I don't, Doc...
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Time out!
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
Stay back! Patients aren't allowed to enter the... Oh, stay back!
I'm the next one.
How much ya wanna bet?
Ten bucks.
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
A dime.
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Oh yeah...
Ah believe ya, brother. Ah believe ya!
Now, wouldn't you pray for twenty bucks, a bottle booze an' a piece of that angel cake?
What are they?
Oh, yeah...
He's in charge.
Yeah!
Big man!
Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
Stand aside, Sam, Nature's callin'.
Tha's your problem.
How 'bout twenty?
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
And you haven't heard the last of this!
What?
Is he in an asylum?
He's dead.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Excuse me?
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What for?
Were they pen pals?
--separate, in the evening..."
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
No...
Dwayne?
A very large pig.
...has a prior commitment.
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Thanks.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Damon Bradley...
Where are you going?
I'm on my way to Venice.  Why?
How could you do this to me?
He's safe.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Why are you asking me this?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
So?
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Why are you doing this?
So were you.
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
No.  Are you're leaving?
I know the feeling.
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
Really?...
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
You're Damon Bradley?
I'll look forward to it.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
Excuse me?
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Oh, hello.
What?
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
It's still the new year...
Does Dwayne know about this?
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
Ah ha!...
What is it?
I'm hungry.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
I never even got to be single.
Is he looking at us?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
That was really sweet...
Like a detective.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Hi-iii...
Packing.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
...and a fortune teller.
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
No.  No, you go ahead.
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Amazing...
No one's perfect, Kate.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Uh huh.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
What about Larry?
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Oh.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
How old are you?
Huh?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Right.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
What?  You know him?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
I have to talk to her.
She's not here.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
Don't say that!
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
See! You don't understand!
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
They're waiting for him to walk in.
Give it to me my Pop's job
I'll get home all right now.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
The moment I saw you.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
Thanks anyway.
What for?
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
No thanks... .
Were you really a prize fighter?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and  I had to take a few dives.
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
Our Lord said just the opposite.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
Listen get this straight don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
You don't believe in anything, do you?
And if you don't?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
You're not sore at me?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
What are you going to do?
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts you're driving me nuts stop worrying about the truth worry about yourself.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
Edie...
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Terry, for God's sake.
Edie.
Well, it's over.
Am I on my feet...?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
What did you say?
You can!
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Nice fellows.
Are you on the level, Father?
What do you think?
You looking for me?
I think you could have.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Really?
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Raise a hand to me and... .
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Hey, Terry, guess who's here... that joker from the Commission... .
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Is Johnny in?
No.
No advice. Just whiskey.
Terry?  What do you want?
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
So-so, Johnny.
Count this.
Do you?
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
How'd you get that.
You want to know somethin'?
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Listen Nolan
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
In there.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
Something's making that music.
What do you mean?
Look!
You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
Those creatures..!
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
What can we do against them?
I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
A situation easily remedied.
What kind of symbol?
She is to be <b>mine!</b>  It is so spoken!
There are others.
Then why do you shake so?
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
Ahh, the curiousity of youth... on the road to ruin!  May it ever be so adventurous!
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
What do you suppose for?
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
He didn't want me to.
Why not?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
Ask him his name.
Adele?  You in there?
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
You were his what, his box?
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
It's Richard Ripley.
I bet that's all the hacks they send out.  Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up?  You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
I want to talk to her again, that's all.  See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Oh, man.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
I'm a tourist.
There.  You see the guy sitting on the porch?  The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
Let's go to Detroit.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
You tell your sister about it?
Two hours.
Yeah?  You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow.  Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
I get that feeling, yeah.
I don't ski.
They found the safe.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
They look like plain old rocks.
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
And what happened to Carl?
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
You'll have to ask him.
Daniel.  Listen --
All right, but...
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
You're gonna use a ram?
You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
You can live or die, it's up to you.
Why you think is today?
Quite a mess.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
I'll need a last known address.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Let's go outside and talk.
Look, what you worried about Glenn for?  What's he know?
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
You know how to use one a these?
Good luck, Richard.
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
I thought so, too.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
You don't act like it.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Uh-huh.
We still talk, though.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
Peter Finch.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot?  I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
Think I could have them back?
I can go to the bar.
Those guys bother you?
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
Is that how you think of yourself?
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
You were going to see her?
To warn her about Chino.
I don't think we should get into that.
You just did, for Christ sake.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
So.  What's your point?
I see better with them on.
Wait in the car.
In the trunk?
Weren't you expecting us?
I hear six.
You know who they are?
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
It's a little late for me.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
What's to think about?
You goin' right back to work?
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
How are you, Richard?
Have they got Midge up there?
Don't be an asshole, Richard.  They're gonna kill you.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
Meaning?
There were others.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Hejira.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Like what?
Jesus, I don't believe it.
You're not?
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Really?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
You're a fighter?
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
You're not my type.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
You not with probation, one of those?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Dad...
What'd I say?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
Was it Foley?
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
I didn't have time.
It's possible.  Why?
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
How do I look, mama?
I've heard a lot about you, Mr. Sisco.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
What?
Midge.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
You mean hiding them?
I wish she could forget him.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
What lizard?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
How could you do this?
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
So what are you saying?
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
They're all over us!
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
No.  You're trying to beat me.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Well...sure.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
What's your name?
How often you fight like this?
Thank you, 'Mam.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
We're all going away.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
It must of been a convincing letter.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning, the second is attacking now, and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave, Admiral.
What if the Japanese did invade?
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
You see us as capable of such a blow?
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
Do you believe in all of that?
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
I can't. It's all too much.
Where is it?
I'll call you Later.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Peggy Sue!
And we're here on the couch...
You got a Tab?
Charlie! Am I dead?
I call this the staccato. 
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Thanks.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
Charlie, how are you?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
I'm sorry Charlie.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Charlie. About last nights..
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
But what has to be different?
How'd you know about that?
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
That's real big of you.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Come back to me.
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
I wish she hadn't.
But I'm remembering the future.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
Is that one of your poems?
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Young lady, you're drunk!
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
For me?
I closed my Christmas club.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Oh no!
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Mom!
How do you feel?
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Maddy's party.
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Isn't that awfully forward?
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
You look exactly the same.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
What's that?
I	know what a burrito is.
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
Wbat're you talking about?
Hi, Richard.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Will you take of f your blouse?
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
Out?
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
How long ago did this guy retire?
Hey! Where're you off to?
What are you talking about?
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
Zowie...
I'm not burying him here...
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
I gotta go back and do my chores...
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
I know, Mom.
What in God's name... ?
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Aren't you giving an exam?
Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and...  I will be back. An hour, tops.
You're going to the office?!
Jerk... What did you say?
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
What's wrong with you?
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
Maybe you should think about it.
Thanks for coming in.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage!
Congratulations.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
I buy that.
I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
Find a lawyer?
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
They didn't fire her?
We're friends of Beckett's.
Correct.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
Except... you were gay?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
Yes. On my torso.
What?
What kind of movies do they show there?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
No.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Hello?
I'm fine.
Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ...  Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns.  My platelets look good too.
Were you recently promoted?
I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
Objection!
Objection!
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
Right.
That's correct.
Were you pleased with his work?
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
Lots.
Duh...
Probably since she was born.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
You taught him a lesson.
Yes, we did.
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
If it please Your Honor, we <u>hope</u> to settle this matter.
He was doing a great job.
... keep them from that area, on grounds of relevancy.  What, Bob?
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
Gonna lose everybody out here....
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
Tell me that was you.
Oh, Lord....
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
They're coming.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
But I just wanted to say --
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Back to the ship, huh?
As fast as you can.
You sure you can keep --
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
How many bottles?
Possibly.
I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
What, switch what?
We just keep him locked up forever?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Like what?
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
He used that?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Let's just be sure.
How many?
Let's wait on the power cells.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
We're just burnin' light here.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
We aren't completely stupid.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Well? Is it just the pump?
Why did I fall on you?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Fry?
One is all?
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Where's Mr. Johns?
Get the girl back under. Keep going.
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
We crossed our own tracks.
A toast to whatever he just said.
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
I'd rather piss glass.
Think about that reward, Johns.
<u>Fuck me</u>. You said "clear."
Said "looks clear."
Well, what's it look like now?
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
What's her name, anyway?
Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?
Take it.
Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
How did you know we'd come here?
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
Seal the cave?
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
No.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
The evidence was very meager --
You didn't think so then.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
Yo!
Yo!
Which direction?
Will he live?
Hmph.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Objection!
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
He's trying to form words.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
long pause) You know it.
Climb off me, will you!
Who are you?
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel, Lucius?
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Lucius.
I think you're making a mistake.
What?
I told you not to bring the other one.
Who put them up?
Why special?
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
Thats a lie!
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Of course.
Then there is another jungle?
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
It's him...Landon.
Which one?
Maybe not.
You want her that much?
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Why not?
Would you like to come along?
How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Fuck you bitch.
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Fuck that redneck noise, dude. All dem chicks be rappin' how dey losin' der' ho's and how dey ain't got no bread for beer. Fuck dat honky shit. Got to get me some motown jams, dig it?
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
You lame Taylor?
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
...But what'd she do?
Dawn! That was it!
And you, do you believe?
Okay - got light duty, three days.
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
What we got here a crusader?
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
Alright, Six says torch this place! Blow the weapons in place. Round up all suspected Vee Cees and shake it up! We ain't got much light left.
Whatcha doing in the underworld Taylor?
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
Right on.
And Baaaaaaa! back on you.
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Indefinitely?
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
I'm supposing.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
I'm sure you have.
How long would that take?
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
Your liquor laws..
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
I didn't say anything.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Dance?
They'll know whether he killed himself.
There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
Dance? Here?
Why not?
Couldn't be.
Why?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.
No percentage in that.
They're going to arrest me.
How bad is it?  Bad enough for-- 
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
They'll look for you.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
See anything?
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
In a way.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
Not this one.  And not Mitchell.
You-killed-him?
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
I think you mean that.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Ale. I don't mind.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
I'm sorry, that's all there is.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
FLorida?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
Is it a crime?
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
They call me Jeff.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
I know that.
There's an empty taxi across the street.  If you're so anxious, take it.  He'll know the way to the police headquarters.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
You mentioned information.
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
Thank you.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
In case you want to have us followed.
Time for a little chat?
I never notice the view after the first week.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
What?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
A little something on account perhaps?
Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
Passkey?
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Mr. Clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
I'm sorry, Inspector, I don't know much about..
I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
Got a moment, Inspector?
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
Would you?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
I'll know when I find it.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
I think so.
Such as?
Well.  What about it?
I've handled it.  Mitchell's handed it.  If I wipe it off, no suicide. If I take it out and lose it, no suicide.  If I leave it here....no suicide.
And she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
I never saw it before.
What about me?
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
I am a fool.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Not if it clears the air.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Now, you're being beastly.
And if you didn't believe me?
No doubt about that one.
He checks too.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
Get out of here!
What are my orders, sir?
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Why should I mind?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
That's not very kind.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
How about your new friend?
I told you she's just..
I'm sorry. I forgot about calling for you.
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
It's fine, thank you.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
Charles!  I didn't know you were back.  Have a good holiday?
Not too bad, thanks.  How have you been?
I'm not sure I can face it.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Of course.
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
...break away completely from--
And some of that.  Sorry.
Good.
Can I give you a lift?
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
I thought it was tremendous.
Oh, but he was terrific.
I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
Damn.  They're early.
Again?
You don't trust me.
Did she talk about me?
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
I might.
In your car
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
What have you been up to?
The torture of small children--
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Perhaps I will, then.
Still in love?
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
Why not sit down and wait?
What period?
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
I'm not here.
Dad.
Yes, you said.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
No.
What would you call it?
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
She said that?
What have you got there?
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
Where?
Don't you gamble?
Talk.
You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
Wild ride, huh?
Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
A little mushy.
Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Good move.
They don't go for the vault?
Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
Got it.
... so I started tailing him.
Did he rob it?
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Time for lunch.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Shrimp and fries.
Nice place.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Meaning you were expendable.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
You had enough?
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Those are cold.
Ouch.
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Bye.
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
Jesus... this is inhuman.  Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here.
We're going to need everyone.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
He knows our defenses.
He's not really my uncle.
I like your hat.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
You've got a lot of nerve.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
Mr. Harris.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
You looking' for some company?
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Nice car.  Yours?
It pays.
So do day jobs.
For the whole night?
No, but it's getting there.
Get in.  This side.
What?
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
Do you plan everything?
Let's talk some more first.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
And why do you say that?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Where'd you go?
Mmm, I could tell.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
I sell them.
Vivian --
It'd cost you.
Of course.  How much?
Four thousand.
All right, two thousand.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Did you buy some clothes?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
This isn't a date.
And that's the way the game is played.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Was someone rude to you?
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
You always been rich?
No.
I think it's exciting.
What id we run into someone I know?
Real genuine guy.
He's good at what he does.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
What's that?
You won't.
I know.  I'm glad.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
What do you mean?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
I got tired of hating my father.
Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Love this car!  Is it new?
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I'll see you in the office.  By the way, about your car...
Edward, did you hear me?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
I'm up.
You broke my nose.
All this because of that whore!
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
He... he just does.
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah... I know what you mean.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Dummy.
I pray for that.
Go for the bucks.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
Want a pair of boots?
Rent.  You're late.
Kit give me nothin'.
I leave extras, miss.
Niece?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
But I always eat like this.
I like steak.
Miss Vivian --
Barnard Thomas here.  Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  There's someone here to see you.
Are you looking for something in particular?
Yes.  Something... conservative.
What is with you?
Would you like to try it on?
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
Every ship but the four you sent.
He knows I do not love him.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You mock my pain!
Nothing you can say will upset me.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
And what am I?
Well ... you were dead.
I will never doubt again.
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
What?
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
You're quick.
Why is that, do you think?
Who's Guilder?
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
Faster!
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
Hello.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
I don't think more than ten.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
But you don't know where he is.
The Man in Black?
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Will this do?
Where did you get that?
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
-hold it, hold it-
-- wait, just wait --
Westley's only faking, right?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Yellin.
It won't be easy, Sire.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
Now?
-- yes --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Are you a rotten liar.
Thank you for everything.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
You are ready, then?
There's something I ought to tell you.
Who are you?!
No one of consequence.
Kill me quickly.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
I smell nothing.
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
You've made your decision then7
What's so funny?
You guessed wrong.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
Nobody's hearing nothing!
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
What are you saying?
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery moon,
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Yes sir.
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
I have hurt your feelings.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
What are you doing?
Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
To failure!
Maybe it's not true!
I never should have listened to you.
Vaaaat???
Franz, don't you see, Hitler was a man of his time.  This is a man of his time.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Get car.  Get car.
Oh, the best one.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
I shall count the minutes.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
Wagner...
Hindenburg...
What have you done, LSD?
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
We won.
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Tell me all about her.
How early?
Or arrived with her.
No.
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
Cash or check? For the cabin...
She isn't still here, is she?
Someone is sitting in that window.
Now, look...!
Why?
Someone has seen her. Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  She is your girl friend, isn't she?
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Can I trade in my car and take another?
How much?
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
Were there any calls?
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
She stole some money.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
With the forty thousand dollars?
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Please!
What difference does that...
Did he say anything about my sister?
May I talk to you?
I'm Mary's sister.
What should I know?
Huh?
I hate tears. 
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
You want me to stay here?
She'll need both of us.
I feel better when you feel better.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
Sam, I'm going.
Stay here.
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Well?
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Yes.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
Watch your tenses.
You going to wait here for me?
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
Why not?
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
Can you?
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Sam! No!
Mary, whenever it's possible, tax- deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.  Even respectability.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
Dirty night.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I'm sorry. I wish... people could apologize for other people.
Why do you ask that?
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Except you.
To a private island, like you?
Yes, and just one time can be enough.  Thank you.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
Phoenix?
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
I'd like to, but...
Crane.
You slept here all night?
No, m'am.
Is there?
Oh?
Norman took a wife?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
I suppose you want a cabin.
It isn't necessary.
Looking for me?
Satisfied with your cabin?
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
...Forty thousand dollars!
Was that all?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Did she talk?
Gosh, you had me fooled.
Then you knew of the inheritance?
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
Who are you? What is your name?
No, I don't want money. I only want to find out who you are and where you live. My business is finding peo- ple. Not taking their money.
You--a friend to me?
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
How do you do.
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Take me down there.
I'm losing my blood!
That spoke to you?
Yes.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
Yes, why?
What are you laughing at?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
No -- I -- wanted to speak to Ralph. We had a silly argument last night and I said something unkind.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
What! What are you talking about?
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
What do you think I am?
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
You mean he was colored?
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
Well, ain't that a shame. Nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
I am right! I know I'm right!
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?
You used to go to Worth's place a whole lot. What makes you sure it wasn't there?
No kiddin'.
No foolin' -- any suspect?
Do you know George Winton?
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
He might get some publicity out of it.
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
I see. Was that all she said?
You weren't going with her?
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
Who'd steal her body?
Not even then. The police are the proper people to conduct this affair. Now if you've got any suspicions I'll drive you to the nearest police station.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
Heaven knows. A lot.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
It will always afford me great pleasure to see you. 
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
To lunch.
To lunch, you say. I am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. We are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
I'd be glad to, Mr. Igor.  I think I'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
What are you laughing at?
Two: what if I didn't miss?
Could we go somewhere?
I'm heading out of town.
What?
We flopped the first time out.
What universe are you in, Paul?
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
I've been dreaming about this.
Yes?
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
Where is she?
They're filthy, Mother.
I know, Mother.
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
In what sense were they bad?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
What'd you do, Rose?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
Well, some fiend might.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose.
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
But Rose...
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life.  Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
He did?
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Okay.
Well, a little.
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
Yeah, he's still up there.
But how would you find him?
The new girl is here.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night.  And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
Heh, what a hypocrite.
It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape.
This is my place and you can't have it.
What are they doing, Doll?
He had his hand on her titty.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Is her husband sick or something?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Of course.
I think we both know her.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
Oh. Did you say something?
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
She will succeed.
Well, she loves children, all right.  She loves everybody.
What time is it?
No reason at all, darlin'.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
I am not being brutal to her!
Boys? You say to me boys?
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do.
It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
What did you forget?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
No, sir.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Is this ill right?
Well, Rose, my sleep was a little disturbed last night, and so was Mrs. Hillyer's, and so was the children's. How about you? Was your sleep disturbed, too?
Yes, sir.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
Your baby?
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
Took your time gettin' here.
Um-m, well...
You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
What's the matter with him?
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Never again, never again...
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
Indivisible and inseparable.
Incestuous.
And... ?
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Who cares?
You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
Lay off once, would you?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
You shouldn't litter.
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
I... I can't find my seatbelt.
Sons of bitches!
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
All I got is being a cop.  What do I do if I'm not that?
No offices are gonna be open today.
That's sick.
What's the plan?
I don't know what the problem is. Plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
They shot us all, kid.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Wha... ?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
Bullshit.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
Nope.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
You going rogue on me?
Maybe.
Well, sir...
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
Couldn't have said it better myself.
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
I'm gonna get beside.  Nena, you're gonna shoot out his tires.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Dead.
Hey-Ho... !  Maybe we're not alone in this thing after all.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
Why the beach?
When you bunch it together, it's exponentially more powerful.  Two sticks have the power of four sticks. Four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
Yeah.
You always did have style.
This shit was Ming.
Where's your pet gorilla and the female Uncle Tom?
They're... around.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.
Yoda spoke of another.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Where am I?
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
They are clear, my Master.
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Han!
Wouldn't miss it.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
Vader's on that ship.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing.  Han, can you reach my lightsaber?
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Shall we try and go around?
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Lando, grab it!
Lower it!
Good luck.
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
Good, I hate long waits.
Here we go again.
What did he say?
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Oh!
What do you remember?
Yes. It's you Leia.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
The Emperor has been expecting you.
I know, father.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Told you, did he?
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
Yes.
Yes Brad.
Uh huh.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
What was that bang?
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
Well I want to leave.
Oh Brad.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Promise you won't tell Brad.
What a guy
Wheeling

Dealing
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
I think you had better both come inside.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
I think it's closed.
I just dislocated my finger.
What's funny?
Some people are very shy by nature.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
I don't think you're a bum.
...Guess.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
I think he might be worried.
It's okay.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
Do me another favor?
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Yes.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
What're we going to do?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
Why?
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Paulie!
...Paulie. Stop now!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Owe you what?
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
He got lucky.
My side.
Get that doctor.
No doctor!
You're hurtin', man!
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Fouls.
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Of wa?
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Kiss my ass.
No wine.
Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
That's ten bucks.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
I say ya nothin'!
Yo' yellow, old man.
What's ya name again?
...The juice is climbin' every week.
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Black market?
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
What?
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
Why?
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Yeah.
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Think about it.
Did ya get the message, kid?
Ya puttin' me on?
When was they here?
Yeah.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Really think so?
Ya got heart.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
See how fast he is -- damn!
Damn! How's it look?
...The guy's great.
Fine... That guy's great.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Bullmastiff.
Yo, Paulie.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
I'll do okay.
Gazzo's a good man.
Whatta you think?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
...People talk to me more.
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it, Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
A tweeting bird?
Please, Raoul.  I can give you stars, I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
Yeah, Eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
I'll bet.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
You?
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Does it hurt?
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Toons aren't given imperfections.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Oh, please don't make fun of me, Mr, Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
You shot Roger.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
What's with the dip?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
I don't work in Toontown.
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Have you got the will?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No, I don't.
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
What the hell are you doin'?
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Does this help?
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
Here you go, kid... say hi to Casper for me.
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
Me.
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
Keep reading...
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
Leave Me!
Then I'll leave thee.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Is the day so young?
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Of love?
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
What dares the slave Come hither, To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
He shall be endured
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Where is my Lady's lord?
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
[Within] Juliet!
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
[Within] Juliet!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Ahhh!
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
If my heart's dear love--
So thrive my soul--
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
From Interpol?
Do I need to repeat myself?
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
Don't do it, Sam!
Shut up!
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Do you have the material?
Here's yours.
I take it you still want the money...
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
I don't have it with me...
Bullshit!
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
What are you doing?
Nobody's going to do that!
Of course.  Don't you?
American.
You think you can stitch me up on you own?
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
I didn't expect that he would.
Created?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
You shoot alright.
Not for long.
It's been known to happen.
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.
I ride with fat-boy...
Where is this broad?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
He says this is their block.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I do.
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
So is the woman.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
I wanted to see who you were.
Know what?
We live in a singular world, my friend.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
Alright, it's done.
You know him?
You sure your friend got the right place?
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
Right now?
Business keeps you on the road?
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.
No you don't, and you know it.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Because I don't walk away.
Closest and oldest.
That's a good question.
You have to stop doing that!
What?
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
You better get some sleep, alright?
I told you, I quit.
You sure?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
Sort of!
I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
Ten thousand right here.
What are we going to do?
Call it in I guess.  Why?
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
We don't know that.
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Well someone's gonna find them.
What makes you so sure?
That's right!
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I don't know...
That's not what I mean.
Fair enough, I'll take it to my place.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
It's the right thing to do.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
You're out of your mind.
How long is it going to take?!
You killed him...
You don't know if he was really gonna --
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
We've got to go now, then.
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
That'll bring me down, too. Eventually.  You gotta know that.
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Whoa, Earl!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
You mean that guy was an agent?
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Yeah.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Sally?  I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
That son of a bitch.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
A satellite dish?
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
What?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
What are you getting at?
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Hello.
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Hmmm...
No, I can't say that I have.
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Sure.
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
She's not his type.
Jesse?
Something wrong, Jesse?
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
What?
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time...
Whatever...
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
So I want the money and I want it now.
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
Don't hurt me.
Is that the mail?
Did they ever find out who they were?
Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
This whole place?
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
Give me the bad news.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
Yeah.
This isn't right...
I'm not getting an answer.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Do you know what happened yesterday, Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night, two hundred LAPD officers were there.
No, Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
No, I just assumed...
Winner!  Four, winner!
Invitation, please.
I got my sources.
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
So tell me what you know.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
I don't think so.
This is your ship?
Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
No.  It's my first time.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
Those girls drove off because of you.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
No.
Carter, get off that stage!
You lied to me.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
How you doin'?
What's wrong?
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Where are you going?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
I'm okay, you go.
Give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
It sounds impossible --
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
The truth is, I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
She's getting undressed.
What?
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
Shhh, my head hurts.
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
Fine by me.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
What about a little king pao chicken?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Very nice.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Dancing?
No.  I'm going to find out.
No you didn't!
We made it, man.
That your gate down there?
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Put your arms around me.
I need your help.
Why don't you go get them?
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
I didn't know which side you were on.
Do you still have the bills?
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
Ricky Tan?
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
You know what a phone booth is?!
What is your name?
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Shut up!
OK. Say what it is.
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
Tell me about it.
You speak English!
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
You make the plate?
Did you make the plate?!
He was trying to kill me, not you.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
Stooly.
You talk too fast.
That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
That's not how it goes.
Want some?
This is my territory now.  You are my responsibility.
No, please, I don't --
Oh no.
What?
What a surprise!
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
No...what?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
You don't like it?
You OK?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
What kind of assignment is that?
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
I'm not interested, Carter.  You're no longer on this assignment.
You a cop or something?
Hello.
I would like one of my people to help.
He is very good.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
Right.
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
We do it to our dog.
I'll get the dress.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
Bob's in a hurry.
Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse.
Maggie!
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
You're coming here?
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
She's a cacophony of contradictions.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Same as you said.  What did you call her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
That's fair.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
Give me that!
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
I think so.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
You afraid to try?
Always a mood killer.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
You don't know.
No.
Of course.
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
Brian told you that?
Yes I do!
I love you.  I love you.
To who?  Are you asking me?
Yes, you!
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
Used?
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
I'm listening.
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
I'm just finishing up, too.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
What are you talking about?
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.
Is there somebody else?
I hate boats.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
Is that all right with you?
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Who is it?
I told you.  Nothing --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Men never get this movie.
Did you talk to him?
Becky?
What?
I love you, too.
No, I'm not. 
What are your plans in New York?
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
Are you Annie?
Howard.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Are his folks nice?
You know.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Great.  This is great.  The whole town knows.  Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
All righ...
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
It's been about a year and a half.
What are you going to do, Sam?
What was it that made you know?
I don't think I could really describe it.
No.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
It is not --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Seventy... eight.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Eighty dollars.
I don't know.  Do I?
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
It's a spice rack.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
How did they get our phone number?
Will she scratch up your back?
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Are you going with her?
Did too.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
What if I couldn't get to you?
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
No.
I can't believe you flew first class.
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
What about camping?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Well...
Hi.
Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutes and done.  Ready to eat.  Do you know how to make juice?
Hi.
I thought you were never going to call me.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
It takes time --
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
Mornin'.
Whose side are you on anyway?
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
To the mine?
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
Where you going?
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
Was it expensive, the beer?
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
You all right?
You might get hurt.  Listen, if you think I'm gonna play nursemaid from now on, you're crazy ... I've had these kids all day!
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
I waited up till midnight.
Where are you going?
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Yeah.
What?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
What is it?
First rate, ain't it?
I guess I don't have a hell of a lot of choice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Could be worse.  Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
What?
You don't understand.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
: What are you up to?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
What are you hiding, Danny?
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
Why not?
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
I know a guy.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
Why does it have to feel so bad?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
What?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
You're going to have to explain that one.
Can I ask you something?
What does J.F.K. stand for?
Danny?
What?
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
No one ever noticed?
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
You don't understand.
Crank or glass?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
But I just met you.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
Pull your pants down.
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
Please .. I don't know what you're ...
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
What?
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Hard to compare the people you're taking down with the Lord.
I was getting to it.
If he finds out it's me, I'm a dead man.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
I'm afraid so, Danny.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
Jimmy?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
What's that smell?
Nervous?
Again, I thank you.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
We all know how much you like hearing that. Okay, Liz, I was wrong. There.  You happy?
What is it, drugs?
Find a chaplain.
Resistance?
They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
You must be a hell a shot.
Jackson?
Last I knew.
So, that's Ryan.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
I'd love to hear it.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Pass.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
Good luck, Captain.
I wonder where they're going.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
You?  Leading a squad?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
You get a translator, Captain?
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
You think they'll be alright?
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
Except this time, the mission IS a man.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
I'm listening, sir.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
But we accomplish the mission.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
What deal?
Here they come.
Yes, sir.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
And Sarge?
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Hell, I don't mind this mission, sir, as long as there's something up at Ramelle for...
Frogs?
Damn fool.  Sir.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.
I hope you understand.
No, no, don't go in there.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
What's a scam?
Then what's love?
Look at those eyes.
Lloyd, give it up.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
See you tomorrow.
Did you sleep with her?
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
No, you're not a guy.
Lloyd, it's us.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
I can accept that.
He'd like to start serving immediately.
Ha!
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
You should be.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
You've always called before, always.  Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
You're going.
Bon voyage.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
I like him a lot.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Dad, are you okay in there?
Hi.
This is me telling you about me.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Yeah?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
Yeah.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
Busy?
Well...
I'll go.
Eight.
Goodbye.
Would you hold this for me?
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
What?
Oh.
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Okay.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Okay, this is important...
Now, go into second.  Little more gas... Yeah!  You can get  this whole problem.  Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Are you comfortable?
I was just going to tell you that I love you.  I said it.
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Did you tell anybody?
What do you want?
I love you.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
It's your castle, man.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Hello Lloyd.
Fine Lloyd.
Hi, Lloyd.  This is my eighth and final call...
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
I know
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
I know this part, keep reading.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Ooop, excuse me.
I don't know.
He's essential.  Without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  If that happens -
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
It's not a charade, all this?
Should I stay?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
All right, okay, let's talk.
They're not gone, they're here.
Scherner told me something else about you.
That you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  That it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
What's going on?
You're not telling me something.
Where are the guards?
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
Good.  How's it going?
I've been here.  I guess I haven't been out.
Oskar, good of you to come.
I need a drink.
One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
I'd never ask you for money, you know that. I don't even like talking about it - money, favors - I find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
I was just the accountant.
Pots and pans.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Eight hundred, give or take.
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
They're withholding payment.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
A one-armed machinist, Oskar?
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
Have you checked the...
He's broken his pattern.
Shit.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Stop it...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Yes.
Cici. Who's this?
That's too bad.
I had to change. Did anyone call?
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Fair enough.
No, I don't.
Jesus, youre just as whacked as your son.
What are you going to do?
What's your subject?
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
No way.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
I had the four o'clock shift. You weren't there. You had us worried. Is everything okay?
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Why?
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
She's got guards with her.
What guy?
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
Youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. Its a whole world, Sid. Youre really popular amongst the demented.
A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it.
Were hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu things been done.
And we didnt want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your moneys worth.
So we found a compromise.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. Its been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
Hello, Dwight.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
I think you're all an act.
I know that.
You broke my heart.
And Joel's pre-med.
Oh my God. How could it happen?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
The police are waiting outside. They're going to take you somewhere safe.
That's not the way we play the game.
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
It's good to see you involved.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way...
Time to change numbers again?
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
You're not allowed to ask that.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
..this week's TKE kegger...
Hello?
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
Nah I think it's doing so damn well because one of it's players got iced. I just hope none of us end up dead.
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Hello.
Uh-huh. Look bro, my battery is running out. Really wish I could chat, but I can't so, later.
Asshole, Can't talk.
What kind of a game?
That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level.  Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting.
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?
To see your reaction.
What are these movies? 'Amazombies', 'Space Psychos' 'Creatures from theSan Andreas Fault'?
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
What do you know about trilogies?
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Excuse me?
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
How is that good news?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said?
Don't worry, I've got a permit for it.
Yeah?
Sid I can see you!
Where's Gale?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
Stop following me.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Sidney, what happened?
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
None.
No really?
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Yeah.
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
Gale he's got Dewey!
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
See Sid, now comes the part where we get away with it! The part where we win! Cause face it Sidney, in this world, the bad guys win!
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Who's this?
But you know my favorite name?
It's Sarah.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
How do I know their voices are --
WHERE?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
What? She asked.
Owwww...
How'd you do?
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
Nope.
It's on the table.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
Oh it did?
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
You heard me.
I called my dad.
Why did you kill my mother?
I don't understand...
I'm gonna rip you up bitch. Just like your slut whore mother.
What number is this?
So why did you dial it again?
I don't think so.
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
That's not what you said.
Nah, I don't think so...
Gotta go.
I told you not to hang up on me.
Dial someone else, okay?
You getting scared?
Listen, asshole...
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
Sure...
I'm getting scared.
What kind of game?
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Come on, yes you do.
NOOOO....
...please... no...
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
Afraid not.
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
What door am I at?
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
No, not yet.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Deputy... good evening.
You never know when or where a story will break.
What kind of lead?
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
I like it. It's... sexy.
Sidney's father?
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
Drive by patrol.
Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Have you contacted the bureau?
Jesus...
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
I want to talk to you.
Off the record. No cameras.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Why would she lie about it?
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
And why would she do that?
You're evil.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
I have no idea.
And why is that?
Working, thank you.
Don't come any closer.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
You coming tonight?
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Thanks, Tatum.
Come on, Sid.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
I don't know...
I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
And you believe it?
Who?
Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing.
For once, Stu, drop it.
He cuts off the skin if his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in the apartment.  He's been doing it for quite a while.  Keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back.
What do you think?
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
You've left unfinished business before.
It's none of my business anymore.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Yeah.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
I don't believe it.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
We would have gotten you eventually.
You've made a good life for yourself...
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
And I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a dead man who wasn't really dead until Davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut.
It's a bucket of vomit.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Is that clear?
Okay... sure...  It's just that, with my old partner, you know...
It could be nothing.
I read.  Remember reading?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Forced what?
Nothing.
What if it's not that she's seen something?  What if she's supposed to see something, but she just hasn't been given a chance to see it yet?
You're sure your men didn't move this?
What the fuck is that?
Just, honestly... have you ever seen anything like this... been involved in anything like this?
Oh, that's all.
Why would we?
And?
It is Victor.
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
We don't know for sure...
You got to be kidding.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
We're focusing.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
Wait... just wait.
What are you talking about?
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
Slut.
Wait!
Throw your gun down now!
I don't see anything.
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.
How long have you lived here?
You should look into private schools.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
Did the wife confess?
You askin' me to clear out now?
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
It's all right, ma...I been watchin'... Only I wish...
It's all right...Charlie, let's move outside.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
I got to ask you and Martin to ride to the State Capitol with me, Ethan.
We can get within 500 yards...there's a hogback to the south.
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
And what makes you think he's in this territory?
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
Well, the reward still stands...
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
How'd you come by this?
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
That's what I said.
Talk!
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
What you want me to call you?
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Well, come on!
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Easy on that!
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
Why?
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
I think maybe we oughta...
Lemme alone...
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
I know you are...Only it ain't goin' to be that way...she's alive...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
Might at least have left me my pants!
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
You crazy?
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Stop that!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Hey... the fuse.
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
Where are you going?
We just have to make a new beginning.
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times.  And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
But what is the truth?
No, I've never seen him before.
I've killed my husband!
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
Look at this.  The lock is totally demolished.
Twenty-three, to be exact.
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Oh
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Twenty pounds on delivery
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
Never!
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
Are you writing?
Romeo
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
Ten pounds.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Words, words, wordsonce, I had the giftI could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnerybut now

Interesting.
Nothing comes.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
So now you are free to love
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
What's the title?
A share of the profits.
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's DaughterAlmost finished?
Oh, that.
How?
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
What happened to Sam?
Do you know it?
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
God be praised!  Locked?
Who wrote that?
Now where? Will?
What do we do now?
How goes it, Will?
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.  Yes, I know.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Good luck with yours, Kit.
Two hours at prayer!
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Not ready? Where is she?
Be good to her, my lord!
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
When the Queen commands it.
Like Valentine and Silvia?
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
Your Majesty
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage!  Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
I would not for the world!
Who are you, master?
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
Can you love a fool?
I do not know how to undress a man.
There is.
And that was only my first try.
Moonlight!
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
Mr. Henslowe?
Let him be damned for his pages!
There is time. It is still dark.
Oh, do not go
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
My lady VIOLA.
You flatter, my lord.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
I do not love you, my lord.
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Where did you learn how to do that?
I . . .
Wait there.
No, sir.
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
And her lips?
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
What?
Will you shut up and play.
I'm only asking what you think.
He made it clear.
Alex, I don't have the time --
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I can't do it.
I don't know.
Is this necessary?
Can we talk about something?
I want to talk now.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
How much did you pay?
What is this?
There was a break-in.
What? Yes, that's fine.
You're sure? There's lots more.
No. Why should it?
Well, then?
I've never seen any of these men before.
I don't know them.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Sorry to waste your time.
Just one thing.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Oh, yes, it's great.
Well, yes.
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
I thought you stopped going.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
She hated you --
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
Aroused and inflamed.
-- instead of what he is --
What I am.
Yeah.
I think you're lying.
What sort of car?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Open it.
Now?
Did what?
I'm just looking.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Who's going to do it?
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Love and happiness for ever.
No, I don't.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Who was it?
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
No.
Aren't you going to answer it?
You'll wait in the hall?
Are you all right?
It's OK. There's no problem.
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Would you like to talk about it?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
Expecting anyone?
We already know. All about it.
Eh, I don't know.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
Yes, sir.
I'm boring?
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
What happened to that guy?
What guy?
What guy that died?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Do you think you could answer that?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Working nights?
No. But he needs treatment.
October 15th, direct flight, London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro, British Airways, you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds. Seven six five.
That sounds fine.
No. I haven't seen them.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
Yes.
Diseases.
Is it real?
Don't you think there's too much gold?
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Do you think George is a fairy?
Yes, but... I thought...
What?
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
I just thought you'd like to know --
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
Thanks a lot.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
I don't want to talk about it...
-- What?
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
What kind of treatment?
I can see that.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Why don't you see Lester?
Your husband?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
Hi.
But aren't you...
Oh, no.
That headboard.
You going to answer it?
Are you in love with her?
Her?
I do her hair, yeah.
No thanks.
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
I asked you first.
Why?
... just, you could look very heavy...
I never get my hair done.
No kidding.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
That you're just like your mother.
Right now?
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Right.
Right.
What sort of references do you have?
George!
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
I've got heads here, Norman.
You're late, George.
What!
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
I'm sure.
-- Well no. It never came up.
I'd cut it...
It's hot in here.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
It was after you, baby. After you.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Yeah?
You did, I know you did.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
It'll ruin everything.
Sit down.
-- this guy with Jill.
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
What about it?
-- what?
You were great.
-- yeah.
-- sure.
-- what?
Look who's talking.
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
What's wrong?
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Well then what are you trying to do-
What's that supposed to mean?
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Don't leave me...
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
What?
Wash her.
What with?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
-- White ladies?
-- please, please forgive me...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- took a bus.
-- yes, George.
Not yet.
What?
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
I am?
Yeah.
Do you really mean that?
We live together now.
Yeah.
Okay, baby. Okay...
George.
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
Whether or not I'm going.
I want your feelings about it.
When is that?
I'll call you.
I'll call you.
A friend dropped me off.
Now, Jackie --
Yes.
Yes.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
What do you wanna know for?
Baby, please don't... I love you.
How?
I wish you'd go now.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
George, now cut this out.
Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
What're you here for?
But Mr. Norman said --
Said what!
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
Thank you.
You're right.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
Isn't that bad for it?
Layered?
All night.
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Sit down.
I wanna hear about it.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
I know.
Me!
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
What about Jackie?
All right, who're you with? Jill?

I'll call you back...
A soap?
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Is that right?
George is going to open a shop.
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Here.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Jackie, what're you doing?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
That's right.
Fine.
See you later.
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
So what's your point?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
-- No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
Five times a day?
Honey?
-- uhh-huhh...
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
That's right.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Johnny!
What does he do? Is he an actor?
-- no.
-- why?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
-- yes, Jill.
Do you have children?
No!
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Where to, Les?
You mean they ate each other up?
I am, Dad.  Dad?
Dad?
Are you sure?
Yes, Dad.
Tony.
What about Room 237?
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
Jack...
Yeah.
All right.
Oh what a Maze.  Isn't it beautiful.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Mommy...
Danny, come here!
Mommy... Mommy...!
Where does he go?
Do I have to?
I'm afraid it's advocaat sir.  It tends to stain.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Ah ha, it's coming off now, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
And, er... where are they now?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
A nigger!
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
I'm a Wendy.
No, we don't mind.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
It's good to see you.
No charge?
Hi, babe.
Sure is.
What time is it?
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
Yes, I did.
Somebody did that to him.
Jack...
I can't really remember.
As soon as possible.
Oh Jack, what are you talking about?
I just want to go back to my room.
Wendy!
Stay away...!
Wendy give me the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Stay away from me.
Wendy...
Wendy...
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Well...
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I'm intrigued.
I don't believe they did.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.
I'd better collect my family first.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Hi.
Lowe's car-?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Sure, Uncle Al.
What's the money for?
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Where's Mom?
Went shopping. Why?
Are you all right, Marty?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
For getting a divorce?
What kind of noises?
Rats...
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing that is just a... a...
I don't get you.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I told you!
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
The kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a Jesuit. A French Jesuit.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
But Uncle Al! You said-
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Oh?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
You know, I just might!
SING!
SING!
And I'm tearful!
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
What?
You are so damn sexy.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
For the first time in I don't know how long.  I wanted everything done right. Open and above board.  I told Father Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
No... it's fine.
She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
Oh-huh.
Oh my! 
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  It's the last secular music we recall.
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
Just about.  Show me again.
Chops?
That machine.
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
What a shame!
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
It'll be hell.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Van Cartier.
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
Come on, we're late.
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
What?
I... I brought you something.
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Mary Clarence!
Experience!  Right?
Who are all these people?
I'm getting experience.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Goddamn it!
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
What did He say?
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
The reason?
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
What? 
And all those like you.
What's a concubine?
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
And the vow of chastity.
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary Clarence, what were you thinking?
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
So... hi there.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
No.  No.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked hard with them.  They gave up their free time, and they loved it.  Those women are happy.  And we can get even better.  We can wake this place up.
What do you mean?
But -- why?
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
No nothing.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Me too.
Just remember - you're a target.  Don't you think Vince has a T.V.?
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Oh-huh.
Then one day they find you.
And if she runs?
It's a bluff, Vince.
It's done?
There she is!
Joey?
She was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
Neither did you!
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Sister Mary Patrick?
Yes?
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
Where?
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
I will not allow it.  I will not!
Protest to my superiors if you like.
Your superiors are two days away!
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
Chosen me?
These "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
Tell me something.  What becomes of Young Masbath?
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
What is it?
Listen.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Lady Van Tassel.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
What now?  Where is she?
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
How are you?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Other people?
He has proposed to me twice.
Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
And this gives worth to butchery?
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
What?
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
I have not been able to face him yet.
No.  She has gone out.
You cannot kill what is already dead.
What did you say?
Van Ripper... do you have a gun?
You are from the Hollow?
Father saw you die.
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
No.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
You got any money?
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
That boy wants me to.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
Yeah.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
What?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Leave.
It went real good.
No sir.
You got that shit right.
What's all them books?
You believe in the Bible?
Don't hit that boy no more.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Why? Hi, Karl.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
Do you like to play football?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
How do you know?
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Well, I hate him.
I like the way you talk.
Hey Karl, you off work?
Yeah.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Naw.
You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you.
I don't reckon I know.
Naw.
Why?
A boy or girl?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for a Mister Turner tomorrow and a closin' up shop early.
You will? For sure?
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
You have to Karl. You have to look out for me. You don't let that son of a bitch run you off.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
Did Vaughan go home?
Huh?
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
Yeah.
I ain't got no boy.
I ain't got no boy.
I want to come back and stay here.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Yes sir.
I told 'em about it. They know I'm well. That Mizz Wheatley made me some biscuits.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
Well, okay. I got you some.
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
Ma'am?
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
Do you have family here?
Okay.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
Let's just go, Marsha.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
What!
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
American literature. What else?
Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
What about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Yeah, I did.
It's yours?
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
I spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago, but she hasn't heard from him either. It's beginning to get a little scary.
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
Uh, better make it one.
I'm all ears.
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
Every word.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
What do you mean?
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
You don't give up, do you?
You what?
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
She looks just like you.
So you're just going to give up and go home?
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
Why don't you open it and find out?
Five thousand bucks.
No problem, Vinnie. Everything's under control.  I could run this store in my sleep.
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
Ruby McNutt. My one true love.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
Seventeen.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
What does that mean?
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
And you told your nephew about it?
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
You going to sit here all day?
Son-of-a-bitch. You're some piece of work, aren't you?
What's your offer?
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
So what's the time?
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
Well, if you put it that way...
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
I mean breakfast.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Yeah, that's right.
Thanks, but I'll manage.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
He's dead?
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
Eight-thirty.
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
Three nights.
Two or three nights.
It sounds like our time is up, doesn't it?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
What makes you think you'll be any safer around here? It's only about a mile away from where you live.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
You work too hard, you know that?
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
No way.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Uh, actually, I tend to shy away from that kind of thing.
Is it yours?
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
That's it. In a nutshell.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
It wasn't my fault.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
That's obvious.
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point.  Where was the defendant?  When you sent his family their equity.
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
Well, what then, sergeant?
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Well, I was a doctor in the Jap theater, in the war.  I saw those kendo wounds, <u>many</u> times.  Looked exactly like this one.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
I have told the truth.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
Well, why does it?
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
Cigarette?
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Naw, I had that around for a while.
You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end. Blood's on the butt.  Where your hand goes.
You must think I like losing.
Bet there's a few things you could teach me.  Kendo, for one.
You wouldn't even see it move.
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
You want me to say that.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
I believe so.
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
And her farmhouse...?
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Are you absol...
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
He had no reason to.
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
Improved...how?
As I said, in every way.  Physically and psychologically.  More endurance, quicker responses, better hand-eye, improved technical training.  Where the First Psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience, this bunch gives you 99.4.
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Are these your bags?
Yes.  And that one, too.
I suppose you want a tip?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
You're in Berths 7 and 7A.
You're welcome.
Upsy-daisy.
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Shut up, will you?  I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give up for our overcoats?
Sam the Bookie?  Nothing doing!  You're not putting my overcoat on that dog!
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
With you.
With me?
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
You've flipped your wig!
I think they got me.
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
My name is Josephine.
Down, Daphne!
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Good night, Daphne.
What happened?
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
How can we?  We're broke.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
He's not only got a yacht, he's got a bicycle.
What message?  What motorboat?
Oh, he does!
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
What are you doing with my flowers?
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Oh.
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
Shut up and keep packing.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
You crazy or something?  The place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you're making like Diamond Jim Brady!  How are we going to get out of here?  How are we going to eat?
All right - so what do we do now?
Did you hear that?
What'll I tell him?
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
It's all fixed!  Osgood is meeting us on the pier -
Good night, honey.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
Anything wrong?
That's ridiculous.
And your head is hot.
And you've got cold feet.
Maybe I'd better go before I catch something.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
You all right?
How's the bottle?
What's the surprise?
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
I'm a what?
Josephine -
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
I hope so.
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
Where did you girls play before?
How did those holes get there?
Help yourself.
Me too.  Bye now.
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
Personally, I'm Type O.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Sorry.  I'll be on the bandstand.
Wanna bet?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
Goodbye?
I'll throw up!
Yes, Osgood?
You're leading again.
And I can never have children.
We'll adopt some.
Well, it is to me.  Will you give her a message?  I'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight.
I don't like no witnesses.
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
No, we couldn't!
Hey, Sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances?
We got time off for good behavior.
Put it here.
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Then why did you take this job?
Rough?
I'll say.
Yeah.
You don't say?
Then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone, and all that's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.
Men!
You are?
What's in Florida?
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Happy days.
Would you mind terribly?
Thanks, honey.
Well, there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
My fault.
Why?
Your view of what?
Up, up, up.
- Inauguration balls -
- opening of the Opera -
You know, it's amazing we never ran into each other before.  I'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you.
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
Why?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Where's your shell collection?
Completely.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
You're flattering me.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
Have you tried?
Talk about sad.
Have you ever tried American girls?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
Anything this time?
Good morning.
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
Daphne -
I know.  Every time!
Good evening, sir.
Haven't you got another pew - not so close to the band?  How about that one?
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
Yes, sir.
And who runs it?
I already told you.
Refresh my memory.
Spats Colombo.
Just dropped in to pay my respects.
You don't owe me no nothing.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
Are you sure youre okay?
Wow. You look beautiful.
Youd better get going. My parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
Say something. Please.
Whats going on with you two?
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
Um, just about everyone.
Whats his problem?
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
No.
Thats when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Seeing you again....
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
You think we look like were trying too hard.
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
Mission accomplished.
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
Why?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
What is?
A weekend?
Not you. Youre not disgusting. Youre lovely. Just the idea that theyd bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... I mean, someones dead.
This happened to you?
How did you know that was me?
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
And you thought Id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
Dont they have a limit at those machines?
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Whats he do anyway?
You knew?
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Hi, kiddo.
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
Is he here in Borderdale?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
Uh huh...
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
And you say all them people is dead now?
Oh... . You right, that's all that was worryin' me right then...
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
Yes mam...
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
But where is my daddy!?
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
:--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
But, Charlie --
You would do that, wouldn't you?
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
Where did the sun go to, Daddy?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
Mornin', son...
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
And I wanta be with you, too, but this school is somethin' that's good for you -- somethin you need, like good air to breathe, and I want you to have it, boy, and that's the way it's gonna be!
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
What's your daddy's name?
Mister, can you visit anybody here?
What's in there, David!?
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
No mam -- I looked all over.
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
So when I left, she gave me these books.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
They probly thought you was crazy.
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Little chilly.
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
Will they give him a trial?
Stan, your friends need you. They are in trouble and you must help them.
There are more important matters right now...
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
Is it Cartman's mom?
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
Hey Cartman.
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
Your behind?
Cartman?!
Mph rmph rm!!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
What was that word, young man!?
I don't know.
Hey, Chef.
Donkey raping shit eater.
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
What are you doing?! Get on with your misery!
Mrph mprph!!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
That was sweet!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Nowhere.
Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
WHAT?
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Yes?
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
Oh.
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
No, it was worse than that...
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
You know I do.
What did you do today Satan?
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Yeah!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wendy?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
And ze rope?
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Oh Sara...
Jesus, come on!
Evening.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Mac, you really earned your wings this flight.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
So, are you on for the next one?
That's very pragmatic of you, Barnes.
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
Barnes?
Break it down to me, what's going on?
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Will do.  What about the distress signal?
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
What are we going to do?
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
Seen one like it before?
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
I don't know what we're facing.
You're ready for the real thing?
Yeah?
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
What do you mean?  What happened!
So close...
Marry you?
In that case, I accept.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
Thank you.
So I've been told.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
I tell you, something's not right here.  How do we know they're not going to use the pod for themselves?
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
You a mini-golfer?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Hey, cut it out Sid, that tickles. I'm serious! You guys are related, right?
Sorry about your loss.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
No kiddin'.
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Sure, Sid.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
Buzz Burger, side of 'cues. You haven't introduced me to your fan.
It's a beautiful thing.
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
Need some advice, huh.
100 years! 
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Where'd you get this ball?
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
The small ball.
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.
You got a better offer?
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
You never even took the shot. You couldn't do it. Theo moves towards Buzz in a threatening manner.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
We ain't married no more.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
I never saw you.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
He's the guy Buzz.
Millie, I know what I'm doing.
Hello?
Hello, mom?
I found dad.
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
What did you do to Buzz?
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
Where's Junior?
Leave him alone!
Grasp firmly. Then what?
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
He's my father, Millie.
Careful with that one. He won't tell me anything, but I know there's something strange going on over at the lanes. If you ask me, I'd say the old fart wants to die.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
How do you want it?  The eggs.
Do you know where they're taking him?
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
This is a vicious cycle.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
The mental hospital.
Can I ask you something personal?
So, what about you?
Well, that was plan A.
Plan B is your dad.
Do you talk with your mom?
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
More than you could afford.
Come on, bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
What are you going to do about your brother?
Zip.
You got any broken bones?
It?
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
Can I come with you?
When I'm with you Sheila, I don't even think about bowling. Theo takes Sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately. She stops him and looks around nervously.
I'm not dumping you, I'm suspending you.
Some unfinished business.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
I can't see...
Fletcher!  Now!
Wait a minute --
Yeah.  I heard you.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Direction's east coming!
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Norman, please!  Don't!
Thank you, Colonel.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
-- Wait a second --
It's impossible.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
Don't get hysterical, Norman.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
But sir --
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
I see it.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Nothing, sir.
Nothing, sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
They've left, keep watching!
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
You don't know that.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
What's the message?
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
I'd also like it noted --
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
Some sort of lead or something.
Sir, about leaving --
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
Resetting the sub.
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
That's quite a secret.
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Norman!
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
The library.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
My gosh, Norman.
What do you mean -- not normal?
What?  Why...
Beth.
What are they?
... He lied to us.  He left us down here.
C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back.
Don't tell me to calm down!
Beth --
Forget the sub.
Still clear?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
The refridgerator.
We must've had it delivered then.
I don't know.
How can the sphere do that?
It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real.
Diphenyl parlene.
It's for motion sickness.
Sintag.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Parasolutrine?
It's a soporific.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
It's an idea.
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
The sphere looks different.
Your watch.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
You tell me.
Don't you?
You're insane.
Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Don't, Beth.
But I have to, Norman.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Then where's it coming from?
Stop it!
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
I --
What is that?  What are you doing?
Would it work?
How's that?
Pussy.
I don't get it.
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?
What are you looking for?
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Like what?  I'm not --
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
You holding up alright?
C'mon, Norman.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... <u>sphere</u>.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
I can't believe that, Harry.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
No.  I didn't say that.
You remember opening the door?
Tell me about the door.  Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry?
Did I?
... you there?  Norman?
But why would she -- ?
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
Did I kill her?
Fine.
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Gimme a second --
Her legs are in the way.
You know how to work this thing?
Well, press something!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
She told me what you said, Norman.
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
English?
Think about it.
Meaning?
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
What'd you say?
Does this mean what I think it means?
Beth and Harry?
Captain who?
I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
You've heard of me?
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with?
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
What was it?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
The Empire must have gotten here first.
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
We don't have that kind of money. How much do you think I can get for the speeder?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
No need, everything's under control.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
According to my father's tapes, this is the spot where General Kenobi lives, but the instruments just don't match up with the landscape... There is no doubt about it, we're lost...
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
No, this hurts.
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Or...?
Johnny, wait...
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
I don't know, Zander.
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Are you the boy for me ?
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl !
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
You're late.
Shhhh...!
You don't look very happy to see me.
I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
That was just a mix up.
Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ?
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
Flip six, three hole.
Cover me.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
What's that, Diz ?
C'mon...
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
You used to dance...
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
Seeing as how we're about all that's left of  1st Brigade, you'd have to call that an improvement.  You top kick ?
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
That would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.
What is your position ?
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
Uh, I don't know.
Mister Rasczak ?
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Kill the bitch.
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Where is Lt. Ilia?
Find the Creator? <U>What</U> Creator? <U>Whose</U>...!?  What does V'ger want of the 'Creator'... ?
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
<U>Answer</U>!
Yes.
By the Creator.
Departure angle on viewer.
Deck four, Captain; Officers' Quarters...!
Sir! Airlock four has been opened; a thruster suit is reported missing!
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
I'm aware of that, sir.
<U>Computer off</U>!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
    , if we do not provide     V'ger with certain information, we won't have twenty-two <U>seconds</U>; the plan must be implemented upon arrival.
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Captain... this probe may be a key a key to the Aliens.
Forward motion, Captain...!
That transmitter is a vital link between V'ger and the Creator. 
Jim... he <U>wants</U> it.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Admiral, I've been hoping to see you. Maybe you can get through to those thick heads in Starfleet that...
We're losing the pattern...!
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
They had a pattern to follow...
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
What should you have known?
Not for us?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Why aren't you on board?
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
We're ready, sir.
Then you'll be wet.
You're doing a <u>Play</u>...
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
What's it called?
Why did you quit?
You like my play.
It's about life.
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
Yes...
I understand...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
No, no.  Of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
You'd know better'n me.
How can you <u>say</u> that?
I <u>can</u>?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
I...
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
Uh huh.
...lost the screw...
Read the card.
Why?
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
But it's absurd.
Why?
Time for a change.  Keep your margins straight.
What've you got?
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Hi.
Where you going?
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
No, that's true.
Gosh, you look nice.
What would you do with it, the printshop...
Press still works.
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
Pelting down out there.
We could live up here, live up in the country.
Now you're talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Water or mineral deposits.
After Drama Group.
That's so beautiful...
It's all over between us.  I've found someone else.
Who is this person that you've found?
Well, then, what's he doing here?
Courthouse back in town.
Town ain't got no courthouse.
<u>Wonderful</u> scr...
They're holding it for ransom.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
He's on the ph...
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
Waterford, Vermont.
That's right.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
She wasn't in the...
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you...
How'd you like working with Richard Hill?
I loved it...he...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
What do you drink?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
Are you all right...?
I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion <u>Picture</u>.
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
Of course he...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
Aren't you ever in school?
Thank you.
No.
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
I like you, too.
Who is that...?
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
This is Joe White.
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
Yeah.
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...I can't do it, Wally...
...wants a piece...
I...
I'm only trying to...
I know...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...yes...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
You show Claire these sketches?
Why not?
Kiss my ass.
What?
Why?
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
Main Street.
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
What is the...?
You've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
He told you that...
Later for you, pal.
I...
You should.
I had a witness I would.
Who's White...?
He saw the girl in the car...
Town's out of lilacs.
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
I can only write on a manual.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I'm out.
Hi!
Well, you call him, and call me back, but this is it, pal, you <u>fuck</u> with me, and I'm going to tear out your heart and piss on your lungs through the hole in your <u>chest</u>.   And the best to Marion...  Where have <u>you</u> been?
How do they know that, you told them?
I didn't say anything to them.
My oh my.
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
<u>Stop</u>...
Find the money.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
If you do the product placement...
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Is that one hell of a kid?
She wasn't in...you were al...
Mmm.
Do something.
...we don't have thirteen at table...
I want them thrown in jail.
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
...it is?
You hear that?
Ain't no second chances in life.
Where are we?
...we can't lose the wind...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
I hate when you say that.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
It just slipped out.
Scream.
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
Not with my mouth open.
This'll work, huh?
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
I don't want to say goodbye.
I'm not.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
You lost Ben?!
You swore.  You owe me a quarter.  Did you remember my egg carton?  I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Great.  Big ears, too?
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
Ice cold water.
There you are!
You do NOT run out on your moth...
...your hating me.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
Mommy's sick, guys.
You have the WORST flu since...
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
So you're okay.
That's Rache's song!
Ben!  Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing!  Ben listen to me...
Before you.
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
Rache says it's from you.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Planning on getting --
I'm here.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Rachel's not half my age.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
Me too.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Called him.  We set an ap...
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
To make it easier for them or you?
We...
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
It's temporary.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
What did you do?
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Machines do not EAT message.
I have a snoop.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
However many.  It's not enough.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Yes?
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
I don't, but...
See, I know that.
She hasn't mentioned this.
She's devastated.
So.  Hopeful.
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
It's just not the right time t...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
For what?
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
It's Anna Sui, you should be doing it.
She's not gonna die.
Why in the world would she t...
I told her I loved her.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
That's not us.
Where you goin'?
What if he is?
You heard me: leave the table!
Hey.
What?
Like what?
Oh.
He was in a concentration camp?
I'll be your guest!
Thank you.
Yes.
Really? How many?
We had to work. My family was poor.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Mi Jesusmi jesus
My grandchild-baby.
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Oh. How did it happen?
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
No, you don't.
The camerawork's nice.
This is definitely better.
OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
We're not ready!
Don't even joke about that!
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Is everything OK?
What are you going to do?
Well...yes. If it hadn't been for Hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave Europe. We would have been...European.
What's tomorrow?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
So? How was school today?
The same. Same as what?
Yeah?
Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.
Hey, Mikey!
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
That's good.
You have beautiful skin.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Ni...
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
I dunno...
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Great!
So what's going on?
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
Oh, that's too bad.
Yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Yeah.
Yeah?
You want some?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
So where'd you get in?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Oh, my God, Scooby! I'm so sorry...I'm so, so sorry...
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
I said I'll lead.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
What now?
We don't have time!
Let's move it we got company!
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Cooper...
Now what?
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
How well do you know this place?
Enjoying the tour so far?
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
She's still alive.
Well?
What about Cooper--where is he?
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
So, what are we looking at White?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
If I don't get power up we are!
We can't--it's power driven!
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
Can I have a glass of water?
The food - you wouldn't put - anything in it, would you?
I have your word, Mister President?
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
That's government property, Major.
What is your name, young lady?
General Schmuck?
What kind of trouble?
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Good.  Has the Wing confirmed holding at X-points?
Yes, sir.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
We don't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the President down, do we?
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
To you, sir.  But how do I know?
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Thank you, sir.
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
That is correct, Major.
You know the regulations well, Major.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
You're damned right they are.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
I suppose we might catch them off their guard.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Yes, sir.  But so do we.
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
How many planes did we lose?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
General, stick to the point, please.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
Roger, maintain.
What else could it be?
Check.
Call them every five miles.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
Look, I'm shot - it hurts.
They can't touch us at this height.
If they come down low enough to make a firing pass, they'll never be able to pull up in time.
Hey, King.  Somebody at Burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor.
I thought I should check out the damage first. My gear is busted up pretty bad.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
Where'd they get you?
What does it look like?
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Check target approach.
Release first safety.
Master safety.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Where'd they get you?
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Maybe the warning system's out.
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Forget it.
I just wanted you to know I didn't mean anything by it.
Sure, King.
At the bottom of mines?
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
What's it about?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
What?
Yeah.
But, so, Pony's comin' by here to the corner?
I'd get bored.
Ah!
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Fuck it!
Hey. Hey. Are you trying to get a hold of Sooze?
No, no, I wasn't trying.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Yeah.
Uh, last night...
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
I know, man.
Y- s-sure it did.
Erica is in the van back there.
Tim...
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Oh, you were in the band?
Well, that's one way of putting it.
I'm so burnt-out.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
I will.
Score! Yeah!
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
Oh, you were there?
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.
I don't care. I'm gonna drop it. I'm gonna drop it. I'm...
Whoa!
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
I could.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Okay, come on. Time to slow down.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
Hi.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
He is?
Military marching bands.
Oh, yeah?
Really?
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
What was your name again?
It's a mistake to think that.
That's what I mean.
I'm not a nice guy.
I know. It's okay.
Taking care of business.
We were?
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
Who were you talking to?
Yeah, yeah, I stay at the Four Seas, it's ease.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
What?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
Jeff, stay there.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
I don't know.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Look, why do you care, huh?
Please?
God, I haven't seen you all day.
No.
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
One!
But do you stand for anything?
What? What do you stand for?
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
This is ridiculous!
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Of course.
Nothing.
Mm-hm.
My goal is to make art.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mm-mm.
Yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. She should.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Come on.
No. No, no, no.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Sooze. What are you doing?
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Wait, away?
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
To his hotel?
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Well, what about us?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait, no, I... Look, Sooze, I figured something out.
Go.
What?
You really suck, you know that?
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
No, it's not...
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Yeah, really.
For a while.
So who are you?
What do you mean?
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Ready?
No, this has everything to do with you.
Pony, oh my god!
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
Is that your driver?
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
You do not!
Yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
Yeah?
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Alright, alright already.
Yep.
Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Oh, How'd she get back?
Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
It's none of my business?
Yeah.
What are you going to do? Hm?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Holy shit.
And you know real cops aren't half as smart as Keanu.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Another sex dream?
...He slices off the guy's ear, and I mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie?
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
And they get caught!
No.
Spit from your dad?
Yeah.
I sure do.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
NO!  Wait...um...  We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh...
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Yeah.  This summer at church camp?  I'm pretty sure I had, y'know, an orgasm.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
You sure you wanna go there?
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Give me your coat.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  But I wouldn't bother.
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
If I could be of any help...
You forgot this.
Thanks.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
I didn't.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
O.K.  Where's the cash?
Sorry if I crossed you up.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
It's just impossible.
Oh, you --
Good.
It will?
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
Whose?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Why did she call me?
No.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Hello, young fellow.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them.  The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now?  Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
Yeah?
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Fair enough.
They'll love it in Pomona.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
December twenty-first.
Where do you live?
There sure is.
You can stay here.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'll take care of that.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
I want to talk to you for a minute.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
I don't need a tuxedo.
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
Go away.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
Have one of mine.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
No, they don't.
Wanted what?
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
I'm the greatest star of them all.
I made your bed this afternoon.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
You made her a star?
And she's turned you into a servant.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Got a title?
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Haven't got a thing.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Who?
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
He will be. In about five minutes.
Why did she have to show up now?
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
Western Europe.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
Maybe it was just an accident.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
Don't leave me.
When can I see, you again ?
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
You're not afraid are you?
Is this how?
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Just like that?
I sort of like what you said.
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
You think so?
Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
Wait. Don't leave me.
Before you go...
What?
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
She's right. They'll string her up.
I did.
You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
I bet they do.
What is it?
And you think you're in love.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
No!
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Well...I guess I can't.
What about my proposal?
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Can I give you a lift?
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
How do you know?
I can't help it if men notice me.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
I don't understand.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
She did that deliberately.
Your hair looks the same.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
It doesn't seem right.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
He's nice.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
Balefire on you, Selena!
Nigel, get lost.
You're wasting your breath.
I am Selena. Give him to me. Now. Or you'll both be sorry.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
Where is inner space?
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
I was on Earth...
I know.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
What are you talkin' about?
Sling. Singapore Sling. What's wrong?
There's no vodka in it.
Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
Brad?
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
You're welcome...??
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
Who?
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Gee, I haven't done this in years.
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Me??
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Gee, I haven't laughed like that since -- since --  I really can't remember when.
I can never get a way from it.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
Uh-huh.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?
Say!
You're the best, Lois.
Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
When?
Hey, boss.
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
God, that's what I keep you for.
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
And do nothing. Just sit there.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
Is this whitemail?
A computer.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
No, we're just going down.
Thanks.  Let's go
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
I know, by computers.
I didn't have my camera with me.
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
Thank ...you.
We've already met.
Listen, are you sure you shouldn't do something about the bridge?
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
I thought you'd never get here.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
But the other night...
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
I can't see anything.
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
Vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
It could make weather!
Computers talk to other computers, right?
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Where did it come from?
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
Anybody been hurt?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
I don't?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
Where were you?
Superman? Oh, was he here?
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
We'd better talk.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Hi.
Lois, I really don't see why --
I'll try to remember that . . .
Get your head out of the clouds, Kent. Where you been  the last twelve hours?
Uh...home...
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
But . . ..that's terrible!
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
Mush!  Mush!
Good. My heart can't take it.
Wrong.
I think he said a "curl."
What's a curl?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Because that is your heritage. Those are the values we lived by on Krypton.
-- as the keeper of the archives of Krypton, it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history.
For many eons the peoples of our world have lived together in harmony. Then there appeared among us three anti-social elements - what on Earth are classified as "criminals."
My kind of people.
Oh! That black box in our cell?
What do you want?
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Yes, but will you honor it?
Free!
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
So this is the planet Houston . . .
What shall we do now?
Did you really believe we would give up our advantage?
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Oh . . . my . . .
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Go on . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
Daddy . . . ?
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
But he's never there.
What's that?
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
This wasn't in the plan.
Ready, Uncle Lex?
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
I know, but  --
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
A hot story, huh?
It was hot, yes.
Mother...
Do you know where you're headed?
I'd like to.
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
But otherwise it's swell.
You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column.
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
Can I take you to the airport?
You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Super...man. Hmmm...
It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?
Again???
Mr. Romance...
Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
We just take it?
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
Don't let me down.
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
I mean the other one!
What other one?
You can't do this to me!
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
Two.
He sure as heck does that.
Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me.
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Well...flashlight?
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
How much do you weigh?
Where do you hail from?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
There.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
I gave him steady employment --
It is for me.
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
Sort of.
Well  --  you've got me! What can I say?
Of time, Luthor.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
Luthor  --
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
Well, it's very impressive but you built this junk for nothing.
Yes.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
Ally Jones.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
So there were others?
But you said...
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
Alison.
I will.
I hope she gets better.
I understand.
I can help you.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
They just finished supper.
Yeah.
Why?
Billy, please.  The children.
It does concern me.
Because it's what we have to do.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Have you been waiting long?
A while.
Because I have to.
About the Ottos?
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
From what?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
You talked about it?
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
That's right.
Did his parents attend to that?
That would complicate things.
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
That's what he said, is it?
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
You hate it.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I feel like his monster.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Is this mine?
Yes.  It's a present.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
What's vermin again?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
So he was mean?
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
When?
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Tell me about it.
Here we go.
Daddy?
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
Yes.
What for?
Do you have the blood test?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
Is there shrimp on it?
Yes.
You can't come here.
Dolores?
You think someone else caused the accident?
Any criminal record?
How does the family survive?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
And where did you sit that morning?
No.
I was scared.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
Really?
Of course.
What's so funny?
What took so long?
What's that?
Do you like the colour?
You and Mom have a lawyer?
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
What are you up to, Nicole?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
There's talk of that.
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
See my mother?
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Is it news to you?
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
If looks could kill, I'm dead...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Why?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
Hello, Harry.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
I didn't say that, J.J.
Spahish...that must show he likes "spigs", too.
I don't?
I'll do it, J.J. - don't get me wrong - in for a penny, in for a pound.  I'll see it through, but stop beating me around the head. Let me make a living!
Uh huh.
How?
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
Back?
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Yeah!
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
That's the third time he's called today.
But...
I know you do, Sidney.
Where's those glossy prints you promised?  Tonight's the latest I can place them -
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
It is a favor, isn't it?
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
We stick in each others craw.
Yes, but why?
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
I didn't do anything!
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
My God.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
My mission is to protect you.
What does that mean?
Radical.
Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
You have to do what I say?!
That is one of my mission parameters.
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Swear.
Not even of dying?
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
You will.
Pain causes it?
Dyson.
Drive faster.
I have to go away, John.
Out of the way, John!
We're better off by ourselves.
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
But you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer, right?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Why attack Russia?
I must be destroyed.
I'm sure it feels very real to you --
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
On all what?
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
And no elbows on the table!
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.
and totally irrelevant.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
With more what? More what?
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
You do shorthand and typing?
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?
Mine's the Eleventh.
What's in those files?
Do you know where the Adagio begins?
Of course.
I can't do this. It's not right.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
I don't buy that.
I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
I don't know, he wasn't my case. Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended?
Why were they going to arrest you?
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwngler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Who?
Who warned you?
If it's too hot, open your tie.
And what was that?
No!
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
Okay, so what is it?
I'll ask the questions, Helmuth.
It's Dr. Furtwngler's baton, which I stole.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
Yes, you remember.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
He did?
Oh! The evening before, I see...
So, you never heard of him.
Nope.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
You were in insurance before the war.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
They said I was dogged?
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
First oboe.
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Alright!
The Uzi 9 millimeter.
You can't to that...
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
What do you think?
Not lately.  Did you check messages?
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
And you're from the future too?
--everythingis gone.  Just gone.  There were survivors. Here.  There.  Nobody knew who started it.  It was the machines.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
About what?
Bag some Z's?
Well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  Eighty-six it.  We'll blow up the place...burn it down.  Something.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
That's good.  Now, seven more like that while I make fuses.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Good fighters.
It's better that way.
Sarah.
So.  You're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Surrounded by living tissue.
Why were the other two women killed?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I can help you...
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
No.  Keep getting an answer- ing machine.
Same shit.
Projections were far too optimistic.
Admittedly...
Did you play recently?
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Excuse me, I need to explain...
What are you talking about?
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
There's got to be a flashlight.
You first.
You pull me up.
I'll wait.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
There goes a thousand dollars.
Never did catch your name.
Nice.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Right.  Call me Christy.
Goodnight, Christy.  It was nice meeting you.
Well... the red bra.
Okay.
Want anything to drink?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
How many times have you done this? I'm interested.
I don't know.  A lot.
Who is it?
What are you <u>doing</u> here?
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
They won't...
Where'd you get that... ?
We searched the house.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Stop talking to them!
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Claire.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Originally, Connecticut.
Elizabeth?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
Really?
Fun?
This isn't an escort service?
I'm going to call.
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
What's this all about, Connie?
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
How do you mean, exactly?
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Stop this.  It's not true...
Yeah.
Split it?
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Have you gone to the police?
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
And if nothing's lacking?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Get rid of them.
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
Dinner's in the oven.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Fine.
What makes you ask?
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Not much, I think.
Goodnight.  See you home.
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
Look, where is he?!
What?
Anything wrong... ?
What's happened...
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
Just what I told you.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
Do we still get paid for the week?
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
Hey!  I heard screaming...
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
It's still an electric shock!
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
Sorry.
Nell!  What's wrong?
All right...
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
Like she smelled it too?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
Welcome Home.
What is that tune?
What'll happen to us, Nell?
You know what he's really upset about?
How'd I know it was for you?
This is where we're going?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Get a blanket!
Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker?
Why do you need a chain like that?
That's where she hanged herself.
Who?
She was unhappy.
Why?
Mrs. Dudley.
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
Fifteen dollars.
That's why we're here.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
Yes.  I feel realy rested, too. Theo?
Well?
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
Then what good is he?
Not for you, clearly.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
I'm sorry.
Italian.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
We all did.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
We think someone is here.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
This is un-fucking professional.
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
There's been some trouble downtown.
Our black friends?
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
You broke last time.
I wouldn't talk.
I can take care of the paperwork.
No reason.
Huh?
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
Boomerang.
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
You're kiddin' me, right?
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
Not me, man.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Has he?
What's so fucking funny?
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
Steady on.
Do you have any friends, man?
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Not much -- you?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
You just cooking then?
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
I thought maybe you just came for the ride.
Been busy, have you.
It's been a while.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Said it went on for donkey's years.
Oh, it just ended, then.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
Modelling.
Footloose and fancy free.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
What line is he in.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you.  Among her things.
You don't seem bothered.
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
You ever been to London?
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
Fancy it?
Yeah, I guess you are.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
So what's your beef, pal?
Nothing financial.  Strictly personal.  I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned.  A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
But if you're mad at him too and he's mad at you ... that must make us pals.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
Yeah?
No kidding.
I would have preferred staying home, me.
Been away a lot.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Yeah.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
So why would he want to see you.
Is Valentine here?
Where is he, then?
-- You know his name is Frank.
Are you finished?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Ah.
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Tell me.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
Boy.
...I stank, didn't I?
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
Ah... it's nothing.
...I wanted to make you happy.
Ah yes, a music lover.
...she can go up there.
A goose, friend. I was chasing a wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
No. I--tell me--
And how do we share--
No problem!
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
...That's quite a wife you got there.
She's a rare one.
...Ed, I...
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
Uh-huh.
Well, I guess he don't care that it's obvious.
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
Rye.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Honey?
Where you going?
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
...I don't think so.
Yeah.
Not guilty, your honor...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
OK. Boy. Jesus!
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
...So, uh, who should I--
Yeah.
I don't work here. My wife does.
He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
That's very generous.
Uh-huh.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
Uh... you're under arrest.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr. Cuthbert.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Yes.
Forget it!
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
What's left of it.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
Lieutenant!  It's me.
What is it?
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
What's that?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
I'm coming with you.
We will.
Dr. Frock?
How many storage areas are there?
Something tried to get into this room!
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
This room sucks.
What is it?
Not that big.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Oh no.  I smell it.
I have the species identification on these teeth.  We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  Call Dr. Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.
For once I'm glad you're rumor central.  What in the world is going on?
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
So what?
Is Dr. Frock safe!
How does it work?
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
I don't understand.
What happened?
That's not what I saw.
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
Gone.
What is it doing?
What happened?
Then it won't go after the others?
For what?
We have to try and draw it off!
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
I can't!
You want to book the flight?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
Give me a shot from Truman's ring.
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
What have we missed?
What music?
He doesn't care.
Welcome.
--a dead one at that.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public.
The creator of what?
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
No.
Now.
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
So when are you leaving?
You think so?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Who?
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
How did it go today?
Every time you and Marlon--
It'd be an adventure.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
I don't know--
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
How are you, Mother?
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
It looks so small.
You got it.
Is there any way around?
The whole area's being evacuated.
--And your teacher said, "You're too late, Truman.  There's nothing left to explore."
Good.  Good.
Well, we're FBI agents.
What am I doing here?
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
Yes.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
You've got something to show me.
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
He just let it explode.
Not according to the men in blue.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
-- You saw this experiment?
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
You didn't know my father --
Mulder...?
Something's not right...
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
What? What are you talking about?
Evidence of a massive infection.
Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
I've got a hearing tomorrow --
How was it contracted?
And you've never seen anything like that?
This looks like new grass to you?
I don't know, Mulder.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
-- of what exactly?!
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Yeah, well they may this one.
Mulder --
This is weird, Mulder.
Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated.
Where'd they go?
What? What's wrong?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
I need you on this, Scully --
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
What? What happened?
We're going to the morgue.
I don't know anything about that.
Well, call General McAddie.
You don't see what's going on here, do you?  There's four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of Dallas. Lives have been lost. No suspects have been named. So the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. That the FBI didn't do its job.
And they want to blame us?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
I have answers for you.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
What about you?
We began to worry. Some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
A pocketful of rye...
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
He hates me.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
No.
Yes mother.
...a pocketful of rye.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
...give a kiss to Edward.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
You're the shrink, you tell me.
Wait...
That went well.
I heard Julia and John got married.
Yep.  Eloped.
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
Thank you.
No problem.
Oh no... No you don't.
She the one from Santa Cruz?
Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
Intravenous administration complete.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
She changed the codes.
Nervous?
What about narcotics?
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
The dog's an albino.  He'd love an animal like that.
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
You're bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
Ich weiss nicht.
Ja, ja, ja.
Sit down.
Do you understand German?
No.
He has a little dog.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
He was Harry's driver?
...at all.
In German?
Gestern bein heurigen...
Oh, that was many years ago.
...and buried him.
It's just what he used to say.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
Holly.
Wer ist da?
What happened to your hand?
Have you seen Calloway?
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
I shall be all right.
He's safe in the Russian zone.
Oh, well.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
You can help us.
I said another man was buried in his place.
I don't want it.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Yes.
Just around the corner.
Please keep this passport to yourself, until I make some inquiries, will you, Major?
Can you tell me whose...
My name is Calloway.
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
What?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Next, Paine.
Bring him in.
...a week ago.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
...in the morning.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
Fifty yards right down there.
A girl of spirit.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
Well, there's not much time.
Please be careful, sir. Up we come. Written anything lately?
They wouldn't know me.
Seems exciting.
What about?
Zane Grey.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Listen...
You can help her.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
...this way.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
You really liked it?
...were of you.
...you know and all that.
The Roumanian?
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Martins.
Speak English?
Excuse me!
...Popescu...
Now, hold on.
No.
Should I make it all fact?
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
Where are you staying?
Traveler.
Bonjour.
She means your neighbor. The Scotsman
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
Everyone ok?
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Yes.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
I'm sorry.
She is gone!
He tried to borrow money from us.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Two.
Hi.
We swim.
I think so too.
Incredible.
Exactly.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They sound like you.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Fucking Danny, man...
That's a movie, you moron.
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Fire...
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Disease? What disease?
Which is what?
You're not in school? What do you do?
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
What's he care about?
No.
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
Even though his dick is so big?
No difference.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
You shouldn't.
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
You want a punch in the mouth?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Carla?... It's me, Danny...Danny Balint...? We met at that...[meeting at your house.]
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I doubt it. How did you find out?
You wouldn't announce it?
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
Totally. The family emigrated from Bulgaria when he was eleven.
How would you kill him?
They're liars and cowards.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
A poison...?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
He has Israel.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
Who? How would I know him?
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
Why would Nadelman lie?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
How do you reconcile the two?
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
Explain it so I can.
I can't say that.
How did you get the fucking number?
Balint?
It's German.
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
They're not my people....
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
I've got to get back to the --
Which was his room?
This will be a different kind of device.
Didn't you get anything?
Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Not too fast.
Mrs. Moebius.
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Take a right on 59th...  We'll put it someplace else.
Where?
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
JTS...?
Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows.
How did you know they were Jews?
How?
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
What are you trying to say?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Where do you think you're going?
Howard Stern.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
What?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you....
Oh, fuck you...
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
You're leaving?
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
Did you tell him?
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
What kind?
Johana, am I boring you?
The documents are forged.
Good afternoon.
You're right.  You're fired.
I tell you she's mine!
Hello!
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
No.
You forgot the Hula!
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
And just where are you from?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Is it a poem?
Jacques!  Johana!
What are you doing here?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Because you'd laugh.
He can learn.  He is learning.
Is he alright?  What happened?
Ten thousand.
Roberto?  How long?
Have the car painted.
Yes?
Enzo, wake up!
The medics are looking all over for you.
Is he here?
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
That's good.  You never would have recognized me, huh?  Check out the suit! Looking good, no?  You know I'm the world champion?
Yes, I know.
I dove 315 feet!
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere else.
That's good.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
People say that?
Everything about what?
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  You know that, don't you?
You still collect them?
You don't have that one, do you?
Can I come in?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
No!  I would never cheat you.
... I was right about what?
A drink to warm up?
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
I'm going back home.
So have I.  ... Hello?
Hello?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
You've got to tell me what happened?
... Are you sure?
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
It's my apartment.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
You called the police?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
... And those?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
That isn't for the divers actually. It's for the balloon.  It blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  Without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Why is he doing this?
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
Please, call me Mordechai.
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Any sign of Santa?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Sorry. I'm better with men.
Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
So don't show a picture.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
What's your shpiel, Santa?
I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you?
What day is it?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Mmmyes.
This is for "mama and the kids."
Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
I don't know.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -
Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
What's left of him.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
Cut.
Something black - something on its way to you 
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Hey  I'm over here.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Well, I'd best be off.
It's about the leopard.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
I don't know.
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Tell me.
Tormented -- ? Why?
I couldn't rest - I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
What do you do now?
That was unfortunate.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
What are you getting at?
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
State hunters?
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
Listen, Kicks, you'll never guess what I've cooked up this tine...
That's easy. Me.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny. I want you to lead him in on a leash.
On his back, I suppose.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
And I never will -- you know what's between us - we're a thing -- But this is serious -- big competition.
Clo-Clo?
I don't know  a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
What did he have to do - look at the body?
The whole town's in a state, Kiki doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep nobody on the streets at night 
Who is he?
I can use them.
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me 
Maybe I want to feel badly.
I got into a little crap game.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
Must it?
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
Will you please come with me?
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Im afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistresss brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Now you know why youre here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
Excuse me?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Laurence!
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
Are we understood?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
How... When did you...
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
Leon hung himself.
You bastard...
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Dont you believe in simplicity?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brothers not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
Theres nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Thereve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, its just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.
What...?
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
May I have your phone number?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
I see. How much?
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
Youre not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
What kids?
I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
The company. We all work for the company.
How many of you scumbags are here?
Just me...  Martins gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
What about the staff?  Theyre in on whats going on, arent they?  How many of them?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Oh... We split up.
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, trs bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandmes services quelquun rcemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...
Your secretary, huh!
Hello, Jane. Its me.
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
My rates...
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
What happens now?
Vous tes Franais?
This car needs petrol.
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe I dont.
You seem very sure about that.
Three oclock.
What is it?
Your lady friend did.
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
Ill be alone.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Is she on the phone?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leons Austrian was looking for you I reckon hed have found you before I did.
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
... No.
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Hows the boy doing?
No...
What about his girlfriend?
Alors quoi?
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Youre the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see whats left of him...
So why didnt he?
They lost their son. Why?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as Never Forget. Over the years were talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Costliest!
Very funny. Can I go on now?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
My dear Aulon...  That's fine...
It's a miracle she's not dead!
Jeanne, stop it!
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
You make it sound so simple...
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Did your voices tell you that?  You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
No, but...
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
I'm staying, Jean.
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
Good.
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
Go onto the next question.
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Why?
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
Am I... am I dead?
Where... where am I?
Quick -- hide in here...
Who are you?
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
And may I go to Mass?
Buying her?
You think?
But... her army's so small now...
I'm... I'm not the king...
... and what... what did he say?
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
There's no time, sire -- we can't hold up the ceremony... there's no telling when the English might come back... they're only ten leagues away...
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
Yes.
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
For what?
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
God... why of course -- we'd forgotten about him!  Strange, I don't seem to remember seeing him at Agincourt.
Damn right!
This is no good!
Clear?
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Jeanne, look behind you.
Do you know how to count?
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
But my voices... they promised me...
I... submit to Our Lord.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
Besides, what about these...?
Jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged Lord Dunois.
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Who gave you that horse?
My king.
How many did he give you?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
No.
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
I don't know... I thought...
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Why would they?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
So your memory's coming back?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Yes I am.
You think you are ready now?
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Oh yes... very.
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you to stop.
Someone you know?
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
How are you doing?
Don't worry, it won't last long.
That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
I need help.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
How long have you been married?
What did I tell you?
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'll be fine.
Henryk's in there.
Tough luck.
Can you help us?
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
We're recruiting.
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
Yes, please.
They bombed us, we're off the air.
Mama, that was a great dinner.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
We use what?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
That's better than yesterday.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
What did you pay him?
They were taking you away.
What's the matter? Are you sick?
Otherwise what?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
Yes, so did the Germans.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
But I want to help, I want to.
Why didn't you come to me?
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Pig!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
You made contact?
What's your work?
I don't know how to thank you.
No sound at all?
No, it was a table.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone.
Ohhh I've never been there. 
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
I worry for you.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
What's he say?
On your property?
Yes, I thought that.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
No.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
He chopped it off
What did she say?
What?
She says, throw it overboard. She doesn't want it. She says it's spoiled
What's in here then, lead?
It's my mother's piano.
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
Mama.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
Yeh, go ahead.
Naw, it's okay.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
Twist, you know this guy?
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
You think my play is bad?
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Then why ain't he dead?
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
And tell Cole I wanta see him when he gets in.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
There's always a depression on.
I like griftin'.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Which one?
Mottola.
They workin' for anybody?
What about the other one?
Who's got the contract?
I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
You mean you blew it.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
You just worry about your end, kid.
You think he'll show?
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
Take it easy, you won't lose him now.  We had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody.  Believe me, I've seen enough to know.
Henry.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
The wire is ten years outa date.
How ya doin'?
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
The name is Lonnegan.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
But what about all these other people?
Where's June today?
You doin' anything tonight?
What the hell for?
Looks like he missed ya.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Yeh, he knows that.
What's the matter?  You gotta get back to Shaw?
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
If you help me out, I'll pay ya back the money you owe Shaw, myself.
You should always look to the back too, kid.
You stayin' in or not?
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
What happened?
I didn't get the bet down in time.
No.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
But who says you will.  I got a guy I can depend on.  He's liquidating everything he has for this.  You wouldn't even give Carver his money back.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
We'll take it.  You manage the building at the end of the alley?
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
What is this?  I got work to do.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Why don't you pick him up yourself?
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
What?
Nothing.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
Then what are you hiding?
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.
He's waiting for you.
Did he tell you where he was going?
He didn't do it -- Nick!
You know, we know each other.
tried him once -
Come on in.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Which way did she fall?
Hello, Dorothy. 
Dead?
I know -- I know --
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Only in bad weather.
Better get home before it is.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Shrapnel!
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
Not without a warrant.
You mean about that gun?
What about the suicide?
No proof?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
What about this Nunheim?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Well, what'd you think?
Who're you calling?
Trail him!  Trail who?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
"D.W.R."  That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
Could this be him?
You mean that body-----?
Well....
When was that?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
Have a shot?
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Where were you?
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
I'll get some.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
All right.  All right.
Just what I said I'd do.
We're just having a little drink.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
I don't like him.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
You're going to return every cent of it!
I never had it.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
I wish you'd count them.  There's a thousand dollars there.
Isn't there anything else I can do for you? Have you bought your ticket?
No.
Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
I haven't been a detective for four years.
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
How are you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Perfectly absurd.
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
All right - you didn't.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
Morelli -  You knew Julia.  Was she gypping Wynant?
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
By the way, how is your father's side?
Six Martinis.
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Yes.
They were kidding you.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
There's one coming.
Want a drink?
You're a fine watch dog.
Who gave it to you?
Aren't you hot in that?
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
I don't know.
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
I don't believe he did it.
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
What are you going to do?
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
You wouldn't be a widow long.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Couple of months anyway.
Why not?
Yes!
I've got a lulu -- why?
Mimi!
You're going to drive me crazy!
Why are you saying it?
Trying to put it off on her?
I'm sorry...  but...
Turn the car around.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
Paper.
They stopped.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
You two fighting's not going to get us anything.
He's not so--
What kind of mine?
We've got rope?
Ready?
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
You ready?
What about the gold?
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
You got no reason to hit me.  I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
What happened?
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
You said he was a deserter.
You're out of your mind.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
No.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
What about Jaeger?
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
Just keep quiet.
So you can give us away?
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
What!?  What!?
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
Invest it.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
It'd make their heads explode.
...I know.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
What do we do with the Humvee?
SAY IT!
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
What?
I heard it click.
We're going to be right over here.
There's a way.
You're going to blow yourselves up.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
We're not going to do anything.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Get up and dig.
Wait.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
Wes might be right about that.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
How!?
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
Don't you touch it.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
Oh, God...
Slip out your M-16.
Can't you--
Why haven't they killed us!?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
When did you make the switch?
Well?
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Thanks.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
I don't know.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
Woods.
Some good ones.
A headache?
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
What does that mean?
Yeah, you're funny.
You will.  You'll get it.
What?
Yeah.  So?
What!?
You ever think about dying?
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
We have to go back.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
Epps...
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
It's got a bottom.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
What's this?  Why did you change it?
You've seen enough.
Now?
I haven't done anything.
I'll try.
They're watching us now.
no...no, no.
It's the end.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
There goes another of your disciples.
I thought you were through with it!
Who?  Who's leaving?
What?
Right now.
What?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
I knew him.
That's not it.
Where's LUH?
Yes
Yes.
Yes...

Officer Reilly, vice.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
Hey, that's the guy-
Dispatch, this is Reilly.
Who the heck're you?
What're you talking about?
What?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
You guys seem pretty tight.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Ex-girlfriend?
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Should we head for the Interstate?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
Which one's which?
What... ?
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
C4, plastic explosive.
Computer device?
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Alex-
Who are you calling, sis?
Nothing so far.
How're you guys doing?
You don't fish.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
Don't talk.
Reilly, Vice. I-
P.E.T.N ...
Device.
A what?
T.J., what're you doing?
So what're we looking for?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Captain...
I'll do it.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
So you lost a handbag, madame?
And diamonds in the front.
Diamonds all over.
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
I'm sorry, but I don't seem to recall the occasion. No, I'm afraid ...
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba. 
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
No.
Yes!
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
The type they marry.
Like it?
Smart. London, eh?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Just dull.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
I want to see-- 
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
You can trust me.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of <u>this</u> <u>report</u>.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Very well, m'sieu.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
You say I am a crook.
I know it!
M'sieu ...
Thank you, Major. 
Now just a minute, Major--
Why should you?
Thank you!
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet  and in another room a man loses-- his head. 
I like you, Baron.
Gaston Monescu.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
The fourteenth of May.
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody.  Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
What?
They're all right, aren't they?
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
Spanish passports?
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doa Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
One purse--  empty. One vanity case-- 
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Then I mislay my checkbook--
It's disgraceful!
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
The same thing.
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Hair?
Marvelous.
Correct!  Good night.
Good night.
No--yours, madame.
Like that!
And you're going to fall for them.
But attractive--
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Instantly.
Mariette!
Yes, Gaston?
Adolph J. Giron.
Divine ...
Yes--uh--
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
That's true.
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Yes, I saw it--but--
That's right.
You're certain?
Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats?
Rush her.
Don't you mean work me?
The partners want to know how it's going?
We're too late.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Something serious has happened.
Just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
You know somebody?
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
So you've not lit the last four boilers then?
Why have we stopped?
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
No you won't.
You're distracting me. Go away.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
So, you got a name by the way?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
It is that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
A whole ten cents?!
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Jack, must you go?
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
What is it? A sapphire?
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
This is horseshit.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
I'm not going without you.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
Never let go.
Yes sir.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
Would you like anything?
I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rose?
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Well--shall we go into dinner?
I can explain--
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
--and I can tell you where to get off.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
Very much--
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
So you washed it off!
There's soft music--
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
You work too fast for me, young man.
This is Mr.--er--
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Very--your mother?
Don't be a c-a-t.
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
Sooner it you like.
Okay.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
You mean that?
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
Lonesome?
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
I could see you were pining away--
What do you know about them?
You can live that down, can't you?
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Make it five.
Well, I'll be--!!!
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Not a chance.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Are you screwy?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
You take some awful chances.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
<U>Me</U>!
On the drunk.
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
I thought you were a sucker--
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Care to join us?
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
I'll go with you.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
What's that?
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Next month is June.
Sure.
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
That's me!
Yes--Me--in person!
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
Who won?
I was never stiffer in my life.
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
Are you happy?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
What's the matter, Mary?
With your dry wit and humor--
What's he got that I haven't got?
Get that out of your trunk.
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
That's him! That's the sucker!!
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
--you'd go with him!
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
That's the truth--every single word!
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
There you are, sir.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
What!--are you crazy?
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Skinny lunger, your guns don't Impress me.  Wasn't for those guns You'd be nothin'.
What d'you think of the singer?
Not now.  I don't have time.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
I asked where you got him.
Come and get him.
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys?  Cowhands ride for the brand.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!
Not me.  I'm in my prime.
Age quod agis.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
Here, Doc.
That's my lovin' man.  Just can't Get enough.
How you feeling, Doc?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Very cosmopolitan.
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
But Doc-
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
Then what do I do?
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
Colorado's closer
Praise Jesus!
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Fun though, wasn't it?
Doesn't suit you.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
I have nothing left.  I have Nothing to give you.  I have no Pride, no dignity, no money.  I Don't even know how we'll make a Living.  But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Come up to the fire, honey.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Forget it, Ringo.
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker.  Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Yeah.  It's a fact.
We should get moving.
Look pretty rough.
Well we're off and running.  Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
Why wasn't the ship protected?!?! Why was it sailing without radar?
I see.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
Briefly.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Where can I find him?
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us.
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Q! How are you?
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
Yes -
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
What about the uranium?
Paris -
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
It must do something.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
I see...
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
I don't know if you'd call it a boat...
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club.
Can you arrange a meeting?
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
I got you covered.
They point, I shoot.
Happily.
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Thanks.  Take care -
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
I'll keep that in mind.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
- Shut up!
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
- You're not.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.  And thanks to your little show and tell -  - giving him the evidence -  We're the only ones who can tie him to the crime.
Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
He's killed closer.
You are seriously deranged.
Wait here.
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
What do you make of all this?
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Who's in charge here?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
I was an attorney!
The Queen invited you to dinner -
What's wrong?
- I told you! He was there! -
Take the men. I can finish alone.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
Oh, no.
Will it go off?
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
Pops put Big Daddy's farm in Rhonda's and Sunny's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it.
Why does he always pick on me?
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
Like a veil has been lifted?
You were in hell?
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
Do you think you won?
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
I could swear I heard my son call me.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Let us settle this tomorrow.
Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
What, are you having another party?
I came all the way from Detroit by bus going to Oakland. The bus stopped in Los Angeles. I had to get off and take a rest. I'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight. I'm just too tired to go on.
Man, act like this is your home.
Good morning.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
Everything these days is made overseas.
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
You should go back and rest.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you, tappy head, you ain't worth the salt you put in greens.
Is this your house?
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
When did you talk to Harry?
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Tolerably well. I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses.
To infinity and beyond!
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Where was the last place you left him?
Right here in the van.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Woody!  Buzz!
Which one can I open first?
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
What are you doing over there?
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Hello-o-o...
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
You're mocking me, aren't you?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
Trouble?!  Where?!
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
You mean it has hyperdrive?
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
What?!
Well, thanks for the ride.
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Hi!
Hey, watch it!
Miss.  G-6.
Oh no, Hannah!
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
No, it's not what you think, I swear!
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
What the heck is up there?
I got it, Woody!
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
Sir!  No Sir!
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Mission accomplished.  Well done, men.  Pack it up, we're going home.
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
Reach for the sky!!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Hey, Slinky?
I'm red this time.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Woody?!
You'll put your clothes here.
Curled up on the landing like love locked out!
I did like the music.
I saw his teeth in the bathroom.
Go away.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.
You're not so old yourself!
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
I finished it off.
Finn ...
Reprieve.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
'Have ploughed the stormy seas - '
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.
Victoria -
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.
How much?
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.
Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
What is he being charged with?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
What?
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
Arnie, do think there's a difference between a reason and an excuse, because I don't think there is.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
I think she's lying.
Me, too.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
Why?
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
Oh, it is?
Me, too.
Are you going to?
Hi.
You all right?
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
What if every country legalized at the same time?
I don't know.
Okay, young lady, that's it.
Yes.
What is this, like freebase?
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Have you done your homework, honey?
Yes, mom --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
That's a big word for a fisherman.
You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona.
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
What do you think she wants?
I'll put this in the back.
You may speak.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.
This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it?
Yes, sir!
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Wasn't that General Salazar?
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Who?
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
Where?
A place we have, that we know is protected.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
We agree.
What's your name?
An informant.
What is the name of your informant?
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
What is it you want me to do?
But will he be house-trained?
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
She hasn't called you?
I don't know what to say.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
What?
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Bit fucking late, like.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Jesus.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
I'd fucking kill you.
What's your name?
Great.
Out.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
It's no problem.
Clear?
Cheers.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
Yeah.
That's your theory?
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
Did he -- you know?
You know.
No, he didn't make me touch it.
He made me lick it.
I can't believe you did that.
But you don't have the money?
Are you serious?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
The Sick Boy method.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
you'll need one more hit.
No, I don't think so.
Stick it on my tab.
This had better be good.
How long is it?
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
He has his doubts...
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
My visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
Admit it. We're lost.
Following new course. Warp seven.
Shuttle en route.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Oh, please.
What do you know of my pain?
The power was within you.
Join my quest.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
I don't understand.
Life is not a dream.
I could use a shower.
But he does seem familiar?
I do not often think of the past.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
Captain, what have I done -
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
I have a half brother.
Is what possible?
There Sha Ka Ree is fabled to exist.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
There is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
Hmmm?
What is this?
Spock?
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
I trust your message was received?
Wait!  You know we'll never make it through the Great Barrier.
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
About the ship...
The ship needs its Captain.
No conditions.



And I thought we were supposed to be going together.
Put him in the brig with Captain Kirk.  Spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
I know you better than that.
Are you embezzling?
You invented Space Paranoids?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
My dinner.
I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
Flynn! I made it. I worked out some new codes for Tron, put 'em on a disk, and -- it's running.
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Did you say Group 7 access?
Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
What for?
For what?
Hello, Alan.
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
Flynn?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Where did you hear that name?
Well, isn't it -- ?
You're alive!
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
Did we make it?
A User -- in our world?
How did you do that, Flynn?
Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head  Are we there yet, Mommy?
But... won't you be de-rezzed?
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out...
So...how's the world of serious science?
Don't even say that. You've got to find that file before he does..
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
Wait...I need that...
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
The Users...you really think they're still there?
What do you think?
You bitch.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
How was school today?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
Helen's going to be pissed.
So, you wanna play huh?  You little--
Ha!  The little prick ditched you!  That is so goddamn funny.
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Is this national security stuff boring you?
Put a tap on her phone.
Guy's a spook!
Yeah, but for who?							*
It skips from page nine to eleven.  Where's page ten?
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
My husband is a good man.
Janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
Yes sir.
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?
Uh huh.  Okay.
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Would you say he was boring, then?
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
What did you need?
You will be contacted with the assignment.
My husband can't know about this.
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
Let the hooker go.  She's not important.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Is it working yet?
I don't take those assignments.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
God, you have great legs.
Yes.
And you've got one.
Yeeaoowww!!
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Tell me what happened?
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
What is it you want me to do?
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
We're going to Paris?
I don't know.  I have to think...
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
Helen.
How?
Who is this woman?
His wife.
What letter?
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
The letter I sent.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
Is that your real name? Really?
I took a cab.
What time is it?
'Bout twelve.
What do you want to know?
Ask me them again. One by one.
Burt Reynolds.
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
Wow. What a swell place to work.
Almost four years.
She OD'd, didn't she?
You didn't do nothing.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
That dazzling imagination.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
What?
Really?
What?
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit.
So you do eat pussy!
You wanna get unhaunted?
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
No thanks.
Tomorrow.
I certainly hope so.
I know.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
Tell me.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
What's this acting class guy's name?
Where?
The zoo.
What's to think about?
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Clarence.
In case.
No. But thanks.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Where's everybody else?
Well, I guess it's about that time.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
I can see what you mean.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
I'm your son.
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
No.
I don't believe you.
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
Come again?
You and Robin moved?
Could we try it now?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about?
Do you believe him?
We talked him into it.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Or a bit player -
How the fuck could he know?
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
Preach on, Big D.
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Do you live here?
Yeah, I live here.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Yes.
Do you know where we can find him?
No.
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
I understand.  There'd be no point.
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Do you know why you're here, James.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
Do you know what year it is?
You think it's July of 1995?  That's the future, James.  Do you think you're living in the future?
Look, I'm warning you.  You do anything, I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
They're keeping an eye on me.
Mason???
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
You want me to rob him?
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
Why are we doing this?
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
That's what they were up to!  Freeing animals!
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
Look at those assholes, they're asking for it!  Maybe people deserved to be wiped out!
It's private.
What...???
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
Uh, that message...me?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
He was fully sedated!
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
He's been tested for drugs?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Oh, Jesus.
He no!
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Any parting words of wisdom?
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
Can I help you, sir?
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Harlin around?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Time.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
You son of a bitch!
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Two-hundred.
Take it.  As soon as I get my money. Fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  You don't know what kind of a deal you're getting.
Please, just leave the car alone.
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Let me have a Beck's.
Kirin?
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
I think I burned my gun hand!
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Taking a little trip?
What do you want?
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
Who was that on the phone?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
What does it look like?
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
That a fact?
Thank you, John.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Least you can leave.
Where you headed?
What happens if you lose?
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
You know what I want.
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Yeah.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Where?
Jake.
From?
What are you talking about?
Shit!
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Stop it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
Grace . . . Grace?
Where's the safe?
I don't know.
I'm not sure where it is.  Not exactly.  I never saw it.  I just heard him talk about it.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
Let's go in the bedroom.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
Sheriff Potter, please.  I can't go to jail.  I wanted no part of it.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
He was going to--
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
But you said we could be together.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
It's . . . it's locked.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Bullshit, Grace.  You were going to drive off and leave me here.
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
Husband . . .?
Accident.
Where you headed?
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
Why would I kill her?
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
Nice office you've got.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
Talk?  About what?
About things.  About your wife.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
You love her, but you hate her?
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
Jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
Yeah, well, me too.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Darrell giving you problems?
It's not like that.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Liar.
It's the truth, Jake.
Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
Not from where I stand.
What are you babbling about?
Toby!  Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I've had time to get over it.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
What the hell are you talking about?
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Kids.
What happened?
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
I guess.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Thirty-thousand dollars.
Nobody's going to hang.  We're all gonna walk away with a little something.  I ain't a greedy man. And, hell, you did all the work. One-hundred-thousand dollars.  Split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  Give or take.
Soda.  You got any soda?
Hey!  You there!
You can't do that yourself?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Oh, Jesus.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Stand up.
What the fuck do you want?
Accident.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
Hey!
You're talking like a madman.
What makes you say that?
And what does that make you?
How do you want it?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I <u>know you</u>...  This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
Shhh! Liar.
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Cause she's dead.
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
For what?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Nope.  Darrell.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
But he's dead.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Yeah, I can fix it.
How much time?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
Two-hundred.
What?
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign.
I want my car.
Eh?
Soda.  You got any soda?
You sure you can manage?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
You've been around.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
Those are white words, not ours.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
Like you.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
Are there snakes out here?
Is that why you're with him?
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody.
There is no us, remember?
Stop it.
We've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
But I thought --
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
Time to go for a walk, Jake.
My mother died in this canyon.
Hope is a four-letter word.
I busted my leg!
Morning, officer.
Where to?
Keep your change.  Bus three-twenty-three. Leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
You got a beer?
No Beck's. A-1, Coors...
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Let me get your change.
Son of a bitch!
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
Yes?
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Wrap it up.
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
What did I say?
I'm listening.
He's asleep.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
I've come to a decision.
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
I remember you.
Rust?
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
What about the game?
Seventy-five percent.
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
Skeptical about what?
In college. A car accident.
What do you want?
Have you ever tried to develop it?
Quick.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
What's he look like?
Yeah?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
Why'd you do that?
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I mean if you knew karate?
How much is it?
I'm sleeping in my room.
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.
How are you feeling?
Against a window.
No.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
How so?
Is this a religious thing?
Where is it?
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
What wife? He don't have no wife.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
He tell you where them others is?
Scouting?
Free ones?
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
Property.
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
All week?
I could run off them whores.
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
Like I said, I...
Is... is it... loaded?
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
Ned's share?
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
Maybe I ain't.
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
Jesus!
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
Did you kill him?
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
You still think he's in there?
Well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
He's in there.
Did... you... get... him?
First one what?
Well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
You... gonna take... the money?
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
You ain't shot.
You sure you ain't armed?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
Eleven.
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Three ways?
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
She gave me the evil eye.
Well, she...
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Nor Quincy, I guess.
You ain't like that no more.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
Jesus.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
The Kid, yeah...
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
No... I meant...
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
Well, suppose he does?
That ain't what I mean.
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
Yeah.
We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
&lt;&lt;Keyser Soze. Keyser Sate. I've seen his face. I see it when I close my eyes.&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;It is longer than that. And not so dark. &gt;&gt;
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
You heard right.
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
Can we stealth these guys?
What are we gonna do?
How do you do?
Well, I'm sorry.
Fenster and Hockney?
Three million?
We'll make it.
What is it Keaton?
with what?
You know damn well, dead-man.
Who's your boss?
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
You set up the line-up.
What did you say?
You're lying.
We're on vacation.
Who is he?
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
When does he post bail?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
No matter. He'll have to know how close we came.
I'11 find him.
Even if I was to let you talk to him, he won't talk to you. He's paranoid about being recorded and he knows the interrogation rooms are wired
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
You know a religious guy named John Paul?
I don't know about that.
There was a lawyer. Kobayashi.
Is he the one that killed Keaton?
So this lawyer...
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
Give a guy a break, huh?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
But Keaton...
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
I don't
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
Edie.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
Because he was my friend.
This is all bullshit.
I knew him. He would never -
Why lie about everything else, then?
You're not safe on your own.
Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
Four cases in three years ...
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
What are you doing here?
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
Gruber...
Thank you.  When Debby...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
Tell me one?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
...of Anesthesiology?
How old are you?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
I did.
Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
Nothing further, your Honor.
Yes.
Yes.
I...yes.
You've just said you signed it.
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it fouryears?  This is a...why?  Why would you do that?
I completely understand ...
What is this going to cost?
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
No, you did fine.
I.  Yes.  It is.
Her doctors killed her.
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
No.
You know what happened.
Then why don't you testify?
You know, you're pushy, fella...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
Exception!
...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
Mr. Galvin's...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Missus...
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
What happened...?
I've got to work...
Why don't you get some rest?
You're talking like a drunk.
I...
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
It's over!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
You're pressuring yourself...
... now who is that ...?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
Are you out of your mind...?
I'm going to help her.
To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
You got a good memory, Franky.
I can't talk now.
You use their witness.
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
What did she do?
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
You live in the neighborhood?
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Kathy Price...
Yes.
What did she say?
Yes.
A single hour.
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...we were trying to restore her heartbeat.
What happened in those three minutes...?
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
The Big Boy did...?
Ah? That complicates the problem.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
Almost a year.
No, I'm all right.
Then?
From whom?
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
I want you.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
Yes.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
I -- I --
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
What happened?
What for? Who are you?
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
Just let me talk to you.
You.
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
You won't have to.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
No, you don't owe me anything.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
No.
No? Then what?
I like that one.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
You don't even want to touch me.
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Where shall we go for dinner?
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
That's what I had in mind.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
How does it work?
We're going awfully far.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
And I couldn't follow her.  God knows I tried.  One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
No!
You can't. You're afraid!
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
What are you going to do?
No...
Where were you?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Oh... wandering about.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
One shouldn't live alone.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
How can you be sure?
I don't like them.
Here with you.
The tall trees...
Where were you born?
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
How do you know?
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
Why? What's happened?
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Yes --
Go on.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
My love... because I love you.
Let me go into the church alone.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Would you please go and look?
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Well?... what'll you do?
From that music.
How's your love life, Midge?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Three whole weeks.
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
Could be.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
I think I can lick it.
Easy, now.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
She died.
But you said grey, sir.
She'll be out in a moment.
Oh, yes! It may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  All right, dear.  We'll have it for you to try in a moment.
Well...
She's fucking hot!
How ya doing?
What's that?
What did you say?
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
You're an asshole Adam.
Multiple reasons.
Name one.
This is pathetic.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
I have plenty of friends.
If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.
What?
What are you doing?
We have to call the ambulance.
Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here.
Her fucking head was caved in.
So that's what we're doing.
Well what the fuck are we supposed to do?
I am not flexible on this.
Don't talk to me about character.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
What?
We'll be ready Adam.
I know...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
So. When is the wedding.
What is it?
What?
Who?
Yup.
That's right.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
She's in there!
But not tonight.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
What's goosed?
You said that Boyd.
No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
She's dead. Call somebody!
Shut up.
Call 911.
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
I'm talking about prayer.
He is not cracking up.
What?
What are you going to do?
Yeah.
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
I'm serious.
Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Your ideas never work out.
I don't hate women.
True.
And what happens when you can't?
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
What? What's your point?
They need leadership.
Ball park sausages.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
May we have the rings please?
This is ridiculous.
Can't we do it on the phone?
Why is this Kid staring at me?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Sent it.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
You forgot the tent?
You can't play around with these tent people.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
He's a moron.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
Why? What's his problem?
We've got problems here.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
You go down there.
I need your help.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
I love you.
That's sweet.
Nesting?
I'm mad at you.
How late?
No. Just like an hour or so.
What about the chairs?
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
I'm working on it.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Are they fighting?
I won't even discuss it.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Yeah. You.
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.
Don't even.
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
He kept saying he was protected.
Like how?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
But...
You did all right dad.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Everything okay?
He's your brother.
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
I don't hear it.
I think so.
I have no idea.
He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror.
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
...embarrassing, shameful...
Take your time. I wish I had.
We will.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
She's dead.
I'll come to you tonight.
No, the children sleep with me.
Give them to Refugio.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
Are there many windows?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
How long are you staying?
You have no feelings toward ...
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
Come down here, you scamp.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
You're lying.
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
What for? She'll only look at me that way again ... I couldn't. You go. Perhaps she'll listen to you. Try to convince her.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Yes.
That's it.
And in the vegetable plot?
Me?
My God, what have you done to him!
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
So, Ramona!
She isn't my cousin.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know, sir.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
Well... is it so urgent?
I know that you used to work with an architect.
What are you doing here? Get out.
There's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
I'll be ready.
Yes. Why?
And ...your friend?
Is she coming back?
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Things seem to be getting better.
Why not?
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? There must be something.
I've had a gutful of this.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
Ask the priest, miss.
I have a headache.
What happened to me?
Today, a good girl.
From the terrace.
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here briefly, one semester at most. But he was singularly the most brilliant student I ever had in a classroom. He created programs so beautiful, so lyrical, they were almost like symphonies...
Why would they be going there?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
This is the personnel file on the programmer, Lindenmeyer. There might be something in it you can use.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
What did you find out?
If I were you, I'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel.
You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
How does he know who I am?
He hears...everything.
HEY!!!
I haven't been working on anything.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
SID  NO!!!
You actually listen to all those tapes?
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
Go to hell.
It wasn't a lie.
You ready for this?
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better  to improve upon what was already done.
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Don't worry about it, all right?
You know I am.
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
We know you didn't kill those guards.
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
Nice work.
You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
You've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon. You stopped Sid 6.7 and you've got his module. You're free to go  right now.  Why are you going to do this?
...I think so...You?
More or less.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
What if he's busy tonight?
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
...mmm?
...The Albanian Campaign...
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
Look, look, look....  He's fine, as long as he has his medication.
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
Come on.
...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
All I need is the one day.
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
What would do that...?
Gimme twenty thousand dollars.
What is it?
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
...but...
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
Precisely.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
Anything at the Airport?
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
...but to the Old World; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of War which have, since I was a child...
...uh huh...
Now, the Old Lady starts to <u>Weep</u>, Big Bird shrugs off his secret <u>Service</u>, goes to her, and covers her with his own coat.
Knock on wood.
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
...this is magnificent.
You missed your <u>plane</u>?  My <u>life</u> is over.  My <u>life</u> is over.  What have you <u>done</u> to me?  What have I done?  Fourteen years of Public Service...
...brazen-it-through...
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
Oh, God...
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
How's your wife?
That's not bad at all.
Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
Give'em another pill...
Stanley, you can't do this....
Guess who <u>I</u> am.
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
"...where's my pill..."
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
ON MOSS, AS HE WALKS THE GROGGY SCHUMANN TOWARD THE GAS STATION.
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
We're locked into Albania.
Who're you working for?
What's on your mind?
Why do people go to war?
Why do they go to War?
Would you go to War to do that? 
I have.
...you the Press Office?
What's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
Is there a press conference today?
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
String a few together.  All I need's eleven,
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Who?
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
Three-o-three...
What is it?
What?
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.
Where is he now?
Mmm...
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  <u>Isn't</u> he...
 A slight, a slight, well, no, we're gonna <u>deal</u> with it, we just, I need a little readjustment...we need to re<u>think</u>...
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
...but...
What're you doing?
Deal's changed.
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
Don't tune it too good.
It's too clean.
Uh...uh... Mounties.  The Mounties Guard The Border. uh... those Mountie Hats.
We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.

A beret.
This is <u>nothing</u>,  Wait'll you've worked with a movie star, one time, this is nothing, we keep him shot-up and happy -- the Old Days, I used to think I was a <u>pharmacist</u>, the kind of stuff I had to do.  One time...

What about tipping off Yurovich?
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you.  You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone...
...well, see him?
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Your words, not mine...
What are you doing here?
...thanks Natalie.
You sure?
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
"What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
I don't understand.
What about hard work?
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.
How much?
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
What the hell do you want?
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
I gather you're a decorator.
What if I have a previous engagement?
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
... just got 250,000 shares at 18 1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull twice that at 18 1/2 outta the California pensions. We got close to half a million shares in the bag.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Are you prepared to put that in writing?
With Mark?
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
About what?  About us.
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Your books Master Loftmore
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
We're all here, and ready sir!
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
No?
A party at a waxwork huh?
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
No thank you sir we're fine.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Sell my soul?
Mom.
They're all human beings
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Yes?
I know that.
I'll come back all the time.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
That's not true.
I started seeing things.
What?
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Who's idea was it?
I didn't want to come.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
These are good.
Are you humoring me?
At the party.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Tell me.  I can help you.
You do?
For scaring you like I did.  When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
Um...sure.
No.  No, I don't.
Mrs. Frank?
You know where she is?
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
She never mentioned her father.
This is...
He looked like one of the Monkees.
...just so she could cut them off.
Stop.
She got it.  Turned it down.
Well good.  So you're human.
Jody--
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  Sela suggested I bring--
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
...no...no...no...
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Someone's there.
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Nothing's happening.
Does Norman know?
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Hartford?
But Claire--
Relieved?
I got there first.  Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman.  He seemed desperate not to lose you.  He promised to handle it.  And we all let it drop away.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
Alight, alright.  Stay calm.  You opened this door.  There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Did he say that?
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
She's awake.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Whatcha reading?
It's okay if you're not.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
You are...
Did you...
Why?
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
I know.
Nothing.  There was...I thought I saw something.
What are you doing here?
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
In the house.  I was scared.
What kind of whispering?
Yep.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
What?  No.  No.
He killed her.
It's a flare.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
Where is she then?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
...like it never even happened...
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
Norman...
What are you doing out here?
How do you know this?
The accident...?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
You don't remember?
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
I may have seen her on campus.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
The...
...Please stop...
It's Madison Fra--
It's too rough.
I was there.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
Claire...
What?
Shhhh.
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
Are you alright...?  You look pale.
What have the witches always asked of you...?
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
What are you talk---
He made that quite clear, yes.
-Ellie said she died when I was BORN!  She's been alive...? ALL THIS TIME...? Why have I been lied to when -
Who the hel1 -
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
Better than most, I suppose.
You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
To love, you must be able to feel.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
I know that you're evil.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
Rowan...
They like you ------- kids.
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
And whose houses do you design...?
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
Why don't you let at do that...?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
All I meant was -
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
You know...?
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
That's GREAT!
Wanna snack...?
Nobody makes a car like them Nasis...
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
You alright...?
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
When aid you get home last night...?
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Stop it!
He's got great hands.
CHIC MAGAZINE?
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
So there is only one key...
That's right...
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
No she didn't...
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
What didn't you like about her?
What's wrong?
We've got nothing to talk about
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Well, what do you think?
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
So she didn't mention anything more about it?
Someday, I'll find out.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
What is it now?
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
You'll never believe who's in there.
I thought I loved her.
Get them together.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
From your lips, to God's ears.
You go first.
Ted, have you lost your mind?
Yeah? You like?
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
Do it?
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
Ted, we put a lot of love in our business.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
Dad, please.
You're way ahead of me again?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Just say it, Dad.
Finally, some gratitude.
I paid off the mortgage! I ordered that Winnebago you always wanted! Now you're ashamed of me?
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Hmmm?
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
My legacy.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house.
My new bike.
I meant biologically.
Me-ow.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Then I'll write about YOU.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
I don't get the distinction.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Funny you should say "peachy."
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Eventually you'll let go.
But you never do.
What about you?
I'm very aural.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Oh. Goodness.
You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do!
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
We cannot afford free speech if it excises the moral fiber of this community!
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
You were the new and improved you.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
What are you doing?
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
In a hurry, are we?
Bad news.
Are you familiar with "Heaven?"
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
And where might that be?
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
About Suzie?
Got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
You okay?
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
Then what?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
Maybe she used another name.
I don't know what to say...
That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior?
You saw the news today?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
That bothers you?
Yeah, maybe, a little.
About a year ago.
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
Yes.
What was that?
I want a full-scale investigation.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Oh, Ray... no...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
She bit you?
You didn't cuff her?
The teeth, were they...
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Ms. Toller?
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
A ride.  You want one?
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Excuse me?
You're out of your mind.
Get off my property.
Hi, Mon.
Kelly.  What is it?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Why can't you come...
I'm here.
Hello.
And you believe her?
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Forget it.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Come on, let loose!
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Just like that?
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
That's cop bullshit.
You, Kelly, Sam.
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
Davy.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
And she wanted to talk.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
But I..
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
But don't pull that again.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
That's a lot of butler.
Almost?
Now, what was that?
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
He's not giving up?
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
You must excuse the Doctor.  No one has ever beaten him at his little game.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
You're not that big.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
That would be... the Mexican War?
I've even printed my own currency.
The first.
Are you all right?
Now it's a bomb.
When are they coming?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Airk!  Come on, Airk.  Lemme outa here.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Willow Ufgood.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
Thanks for your help, Peck.
You a woodcutter?
You all right?
Smells like a battle.
Are you a warrior?
What's that?  I hear something!
I will.
You!!
Where's the baby??
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
Did she ask about me?
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
Madmartigan!  I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Want me to carry Elora?
She's a bird, Willow.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Elves!  They're always tormenting babies.  They make them cry and take their tears.
I'm not going in there.
Madmartigan.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
We are emissaries of her majesty, Queen Cherlindrea, of the land of Coshairm.
Ohhh, I hate this.
I've seen pictures.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Is it them?
Are they going to kill you?
Have you got your gun on now?
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
It's all over, Paul.
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
They kid a lot.
No.
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
Enjoying your reading?
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Your husband's?
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
I'm going this morning.
I know what he said.
The... bullets?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
I know.
That's your way, not mine.
I didn't even know about it.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
I'm coming.
Say again?
You know where he is.
Wrong.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
Did you find him?
He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know  anybody who knows John  knows that's a goddamn lie!
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him 
I don't know where he is.
What's so funny?
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
Is the English dead?
No...
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Momma... are they angry with us.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Oh!
Hickory!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
Toto, too.
Whenever you wish.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
Oh --
Uh-huh.
...paper?
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Did you say something?
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Well, you're perfect now.
Oh --
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
No.  Why only --  Oh --
Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
Oh, my!
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Does it work?
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
They're coming back!
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Ohhh --
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Did I scare you?
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
He said his mouth.
Here -- here --
The other side....
...along.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh --
...ting the ruby slippers?
Real courage. That's what we want.
Ah --
...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
What happened?
I -- Oh --
Stop pushing!
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
Where do we go now?
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
...junk!
...of the West.
Beautiful!  What an echo!
Hey, Dorothy!
Let's.
Ha -- ha -- ha --
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Now, now, don't fret.
Yeah --
What about us?
Well, I --
How can I ever thank you enough?
But I still want one.
What happened to Len Tashka?
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
The King pipeline.
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It wont just be two weeks out of action.
Old friend?
Its barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Then Robert was right about a Russian connection.
And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
Revenge isnt so hard to fathom. Whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
He was my father.
Funerals arent exactly memorable.
How long has he been with you?
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
Oh my God...were buried alive...
I cant stay.
What is it?
No. Youll be safe here.
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
I could have given you the world.
Wheres M?
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
You, of course. I need some information.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didnt even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
Now...where were we?
No!  Get me out!
What?
Ill send someone out.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
What about our end?
No idea who's behind this?
The bearer of bad news.
Collect me?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
What -- am I --
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
No.  I just wanted you to --
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
The missing scientists.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Adrian -- you've lost it.
Im not.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
This'd better not be what I think it is.
They're practically on us . . .
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
I think he's going to the john.
Dan -- what do we do now?
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
What new information?
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
Coward.  Giving up.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Did you know he was back on the streets?
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names!
What does this mean?  What does it --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
What about you?
Maybe I'll do that.
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong guy.
Ever see one of these before?
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
How will you fix it?
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
What game is that?
Like what?
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Who are you?
Bullshit. I see you look at everything, study everything, ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Go to hell!
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
Miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.
This is your standard dart gun.
I can see that. Why?
What...?
You're serious?
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
What's so damn funny?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Help me with this guy.
That's the guy.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something, it better be bitches and money.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Scott.. I -
I don't like him being here.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
What's that?
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
Anything else I can get you?
The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
He takes his work seriously.
I've seen a lot of rings.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
What did she do to me?
And I'll never understand terrorists.
It does indeed, Max.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
You have the wrong house.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
The grandson of Victor 'Fronkonsteen'?
I think we all need a good night's sleep.  Why don't we meet next week and thrash this thing out?
From your office, sir.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
Herr Falkstein!  Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Yes, sir.
What?
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Surprised?
And your passport?
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Darling!
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
Is your room just down the hall? ... in case I get frightened during the night?
Is it worth taking a chance?
There seem to be quite a few books.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
Fron kon steen!
But I can't just drop everything and leave.  I have responsibilities and obligations.
Saturday night then!  I'll take the train to New York and fly from there.
I beg your pardon?
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
But they told me it was Ee gor.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
I'm sure we will.
Are these your bags?
I beg your pardon?
I thought you wanted to.
What wockers?
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Fro-derick!
Did you hear that strange music??
What is this place?
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Was he any good?
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
You can't win 'em all.
You'll be getting me sad next.
Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
But you did -- I just heard it.
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
How's it going?
What did you find out?
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
There's only one way.
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
It's the only way.
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmm!
Extremely well.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
I thought it was wonderful.
It wasn't me.
I think you've done it, master.
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
Give him the sedative!
Why, doctor...how wonderful for you.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
His what??
Look how far we've come.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Will you hear "Last Post", Sir?
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Were they in good heart as they entered enemy territory?
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
So attack is your defence. Well let's hope Cetshwayo will offer his Impis full destruction.
You intended to bring your reserves across the river?
I have received intelligence from, sources of my own that the Zulu Impis are moving North of here and threaten your left.
Er, called Noggs, Sir Actual name is Norris-Newman. He presented credentials from "The Standard".
Stuart?
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
Which one?
Your orders, Mr Vereker?
