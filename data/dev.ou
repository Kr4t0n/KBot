I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
No
Is he oily or dry?
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I did.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
You're welcome.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
It's just you.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Because she'll scare them away.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
How many people were in your old school?
How many people go here?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's her favorite band.
You get the girl.
What do you think?
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
That's never been proven
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
I'm fine. I'm
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
What are you doing here?
Try lookin' at it from this angle
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
You never disappointed me.
The duck?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
You decided.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Yeah.  I guess.
Right.
Yeah...
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
You don't usually ask.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
There'll be a time.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
What...?  Do I have so many already?
Call them.
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
You'll always be older than me, Father.
That she was impregnable.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
You tell that to them!
Here.  I have your money.
But it's...
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Give me another one, please.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Somewhere else?
I'm sorry.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Who says she's a suspect?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
Mind if I ride along with you?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Just a shower?
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Alright.
Okay.
Hey.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
That's good.
Promise?
Tonight.
You stuff sausage in it.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Where's Czech girl?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Yes.
I want to document my trip to America.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
You said speak Czech!
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
As a plumber?!
In love?  With who?
New York.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
I used an accelerant.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
What's up?
Yes?
Yes.
But not completely inconceivable?
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
I guess not.
He's got a point.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Yes, I know.
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Would you guys...
You're crazy.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
I'll think about it.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
You just drove by it.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
So you took the rest of the night off...
Luther's on the move...
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
You're hopeless.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Jack, are you okay?
Fuck you.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
How would you know?
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
We got a lot to talk about.
Yeah, old times.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
They are robots!
She dropped in on me... holding this.
You noticed...
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
I know. I was there when she arrived.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
And then?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
We will be ready, Lord.
Found it?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Have you identified it?
Talk English Doc.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Yes, Sir!
Your clothing reeks of it.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
You couldn't?
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
There's nothing harder.
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Is it?
I want to watch you work.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Move it, dirtbag... !
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
I told you, I don't know.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
It was a lot of fucking money.
Tell me what happened.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
I never killed anyone.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
That's right.
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
There's not much illegal.
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
See you then.  Oh, and, don't call me "pops."
Where are your parents?
I don't know, where are yours?
Alright, I get the picture.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
Nothing remotely like this.
Yes, but...
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons.  When kids run, they almost always leave a note.  It's guilt. They want to say goodbye.
I don't know.  I think so.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
No... no... no...
Yes.  I remember her.
No, you may not.
Certainly, sir.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
That obvious, huh?
Three days.
Kristen was the last child left of the people who killed Freddy.  Maybe Freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  Someone to bring them to him.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
When dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
You had a nasty bump.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
What I what?  Well, I've thought about it.  I plan to keep him.
Huh?
He's inside you, where he hides.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
You disappointed in me?
But Dad --
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
Jacob.  We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
I don't know!
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
And they thought <u>you</u> could re- place the Skipper?
At the worst possible moment. Tomorrow is Janie's birthday. Poor little kid has looked forward for two months to having her Daddy home.  Now -
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
We hope!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
What?
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
If you get it?
Yeah?
Oh.
This way.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Not here.
Right!
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
Yeah.
But it's not funny now.
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
It's stupid.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Oh.
His son-in-law damn near killed me.
Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. Don't let Lillian get to you. She didn't belong here. That's why she left.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
You Rolfe?  I remember you from high school. You're a teacher now? Harvard?
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
You know what I'm talking about. For what you're doing to me and to the child you say you love so much. Love. You won't get away with it.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
Yeah.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
It's nice.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
How?
Is...? She's dead then?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Where... how'd you hear that?
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
Haven't you already done a bit of that?
Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
Money.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
I'm sorry, honey.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Copy Air Force One. Welcome to the party.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
Because it is my duty.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Romeo Tango Zulu1 this is Tower.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
What do you know of my husband?
Good. Good.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
No, Mr. President.  It can't.
What?
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
But...
Two... THREE. GO!
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Other way around, sir.
Yes, sir.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
What's the story?
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Compute!
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
I guess this is a first for you.
Don't be too long.
He's a boy dog.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
Don't try to stop me!
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
Ted!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Yes, Captain?
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
You've got me all wrong.  I don't charge money for something that I myself find pleasurable...
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
That's right.
This is getting out of hand.  I want you to deal with it.  Immediately.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
Uh, Matthew...
Screw me?  That can't be right.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Stop the car!
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Can't lock up...
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
How long until it blows?
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
PLENTY!  TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
She's alive.  They brought her here and you know it.
Hear me out...
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
She's right.
Shit.  Apone, collect magazines from everybody.  We can't have any firing in there.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
What's the question?
...We're coming in.
Fuckin' A!
On my way.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
We ain't going anywhere.
Oh, right!  Right!  With those things running around.  No way.
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
Look!
Newt, wait!
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Oh!
You might be disappointed.
Don't bother.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
What's the matter with you?
Tell them to go!
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
I was at hand.
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
Be careful!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
Young man, I am no stranger to theatres. I'm no stranger to insolence!
Ah, now! Here she comes.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Enchanted, Madame.
Ah, love again.
Am I not welcome?
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
Yes what?
Are you sure it's an opera?
I liked the horse.
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
Ah. Italian?
What exactly are you working on?
Really? Why?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
How could it not, Excellency?
What dead? Who is dead?
Are you neglecting my request?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Come. Let's begin.
Oh no. Now for the Fire.  Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this.
I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Mozart -
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
I did.
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
I'll call tomorrow.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
And what else?
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Call me Alex.
Do you like it?
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
Twenty-eight.
A werewolf?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Charming.
It's nice to see you.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
I wasn't hallucinating.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Jack is dead!
Will you shut up!?!!
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
You're in a hospital in London.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
Two weeks?
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
Wrong.
I heard that.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Pecos Bill.
No.
Are you going to help me up?
David!
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
Will you be quiet?!
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
A monster. I know, I know.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Send them in.
Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
How much?
Let me have ten bucks?
I remember once when your account checked.
Yes, sir.
Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
We've been waiting fifteen minutes
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
I'm sorry, Dude, butI
Why not?
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
But you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
Well, aren't you going to invite me?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer
Yes, now.
I tell you, I'm not interested in your opinion.
Got a handkerchief?
Thank you!
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
The theatre?
Listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
I don't know.
Good morning.
Yes, sir.
I don't know. Mr. Sampson bought it for me.
Sure, I think it's swell.
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
Yes.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
We haven't much on hand, you know. If it gets any worse, I hope we don't have to close the doors.
Yeah, swell.
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Don't cry, honey. Everything's gonna be all right.
Are you sure?
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Was it twelve o'clock?
It couldn't have been earlier?
Where's Charlie?
Never a good thing.
What?
He's not bad at it.
Exactly.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
She was European!
I got us through the War all right.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Strategically.
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
I reckoned.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
You can shut up now.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
Got any ideas, little brother?
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Not if I find the right girl.
Sparkling rocks?
Little ones.
Yes ma'am.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Thank you.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
You been with a girl ever?
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
Move you fools!
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
I demand action.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Is that Donald Trump's car?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
You and...Luis?
You never noticed.
Nothing.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
We never really shared one.
Don't make any trouble. Please. I suggest you go.
I won't...don't worry.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
I'm leaving! I...am...leaving!
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Who?
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
Jean? Hello? Jean?
What are I doing?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
Don't tell him you're here.
I want the number, idiot.  Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
No, really. I'm okay.
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Do you feel that way?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Oh.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
So...you hang out here a lot?
Not really.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick?
It's cold out, too, isn't it?
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that?  Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry.
Oh well, you know.
Nobody goes there anymore.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
No, Owen.
'Gonna wait outside.
You don't wanna move, do you?
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
Milo! What about --?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
You think I don't know that?
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
...Whaddo I do?
Nothing?
I remember.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Great.
No.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Right... What's that mean again?
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
My goodness.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
Oh hi.
He's pretty tight with his family.
The wrong place?
I couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for -- obvious reasons.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
I mean, it's your life.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Show me.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
The dishes are juiced up, too.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
But you said the other --
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
What does that mean?
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Kiss me.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
Hey, how are you?
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
That's not your mother, that's a man!
You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
Love is... love is... love is...
My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
We can't just sit here, Austin.
I am not.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
I love you, Austin.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert.
Where did you learn to shoot?
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
Not me.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
No, Scott. You just don't get it, do you?
You didn't...
Why?
OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
Hope...
So I'm still ...
Promised? Who promised?
There, look!
Sir August...?  What now?
Impossible?
We have met ...
Looks like rain, Steed...
We want to help...!
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
'Our revels now are ended.'
The result would be ...
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
I might say the same.
Is that written in his shoe?
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
It was Peter -- I saw him ...
Because you always obey orders ...
Always.  Except ...
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
No idea who. No idea why ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Still a bit chilly ...
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Peter's brother?  But --
Global warming?
Possibly. Split personality ...
You.
Where?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
No, please! I beg you ...
Walk over to the window ...
Perish the thought.
You wish.
That's not playing by the rules.
...Really?
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
Yeah. What is it?
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
I want Debbie.
I'm marrying Debbie.
The best.
So does Debbie.
Maybe it had something to do.
Fan out and look for them.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
I can't sleep.
About what?
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Good...
You better not have too much joy.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Yes...
Let's get naked.
You're on.
Ilene, Rick promised...
Ilene, we don't really know that.
What are you...
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Why?
Let's have a toast.
Yes.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
Good.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
The best table in the house.
What's with her costume?
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
No.  I need a drink.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
Just come down, John. Just --
-- Shut up! Your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department!
It worked when you were in sixth grade.
-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
What, are you kidding? By myself?
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
Sometimes right when you're looking at them.
-- What are you doing here?
How do you know?
You're back.
You look great.
Huh.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
I was doing my job.
Yes.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
I have a job.
Nice boat.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Fixing my roof.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
Okay.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
Alderman.
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
What's to believe?
Yeah.
Yes.
Fuck you.  Just give me back a little something for the road.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
Let me think about it.
All right. What are you gonna do?
Yeah. I'm sure.
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
This psycho can.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
How 'bout...
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
Louder.  They can't hear you.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
What do you do?
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
You ain't happy about the green light?
Look at my lips.
I'm tired of waiting.
To what?
You're now Mantan.
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I'm telling you it's not.
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category.
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
The big one.
Everybody shut up.
Thanks.
I thought it was appropiate.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
Work related or otherwise?
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Naw.  I'll take the zero.
You sound like the media.
What you did is dead wrong.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
Are you and him kicking it? Knocking boots. Y'knowwhatI'mtalkin'bout.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
I thought you got rid of...
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
No, before my time.
Maybe you need to start.
Oh, you gonna make me say it.
Why don't you answer?
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
Your cousins go out with him.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
I will let down the steps for your honor.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
For whom else have you worked?
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
Old fool!
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
Yes, of course.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
Dark Valdez.
Maybe he's dead too. Maybe you killed them both, Mueller --
Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
What do you like then?
You did Basic here?
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
Okay.
Okay... but I would like to know about the other cadets. What they were like -- nice guys?
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
The creek bed --
Would you have believed me?
Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus -- no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives... you have nothing.
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one.
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
That's exactly what he says about you.
Just look. Little pocket.
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Not for me.
That's horseshit and you know it.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
He was our Drill here. Man's older than sand.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Good cop/bad cop?
You're off to a late start.
I lied. Wait for it...
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
Buttfucks the cabin?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
Let's go talk to Bill...
Good idea.
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
Nah.
WHERE'S WEST'S BODY?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
I used it to start the fire --
The fuck are you talking about --
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
No --
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Yes!
The poet? What ever happened to him?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Let's see it.
Well, she... uh...
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
Go.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
No, I understand.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
You don't like it?
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
You think I'm up for it?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Can we talk?
Dad!
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
It would kill you, huh?
Story of my life.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Because he's dying.
You need to go.
What is "true?" I've never heard my father say a single true thing.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Yes.
You know what for.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Leave him!
You can see why it's sensitive?
What are you doing here?
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
Tell me what he said.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
Yes.
I don't want to know.
So you're just going to be vindictive
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
No.
She's dead.
I'm sorry.
Please.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Oh! Gave me a start.
Don't make it less true.
Don't gotta tell me. Me and my girlfriends use-ta talk 'bout them hard fingertips he got pickin' that guitar.
Hey.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
These are whipped body creams. It's like a lotion.
For your hands?
You gonna miss your bus.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
She's around. Always is.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
You joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. Army'd pay for school. You were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
And you gonna live it with him?
Let go of my arm...
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
Whose doin' is that?
We drinkin' buddies now?
Anything.
I'm here with you.
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
I tried.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
Maybe I won't.
Why you say that?
She got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, I'm different. Sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. Girl got an itch. You know... what's a nigga to do?
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
What'chu sayin'?
Nuh-uh.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
What?
Yeah, I do.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
The hell are you talkin' about?
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
I don't blame you for being sore. It'll pass when we bag him.
They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
No.
Let's grab some food.
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
Give us a break...
Yeah...
I can see that.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
I'm sorry.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
Gaiijin?
Where's Ich?
I'm taking you back.
Then take it from him.
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
Work with me.  I want your best detective.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
Goodbye, officer.
He'll be dealt with.
Where?
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
Of course not.
He could?
When?
Tomorrow, he says.
Very good, Pris.  Now show him why.
Industrial refuse.
Yeah.  I got it.
Go.
Your customer, eh?
The umbrella.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Of course he's not real.  You think I'd be working here if I could afford a real snake?
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
Why not?
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Not too good.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
Sorry.
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
What desert?
But how come I'd be there?
I don't have one.
You scared me.
Just better.
Beautiful.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
What is it?!
Perry?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Very funny, smart ass.
Night!
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
Name it.
A wife?
Never drive again!
I like it.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Wow.
He has a computer?
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
How 'bout this one?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
But, Eve, I would--
I'm really sorry!
Well, you had better!!
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
No. Sit down.
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Well, in that case...of course, son.
Russia.
I just don't want to.
Almost all of them.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Goodbye.
And thanks for always being happy!
What?
Twenty-five? Around there.
I do alright.
I just hope this is still good up there.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
The locks.
The locks?
You have tranquilizers?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Sure.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
No.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We do?
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
Yes, dear, I know.
What can I offer you, Eve?
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
I think...it...works.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
Those sluts!
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
What?!
Stop!
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Stand by. One.
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
The criminals are winning.
Yes.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Shit. You better tell me something.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Frank? Can you stand up?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Yes.
Sometimes I think I do.
You what?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
You called me Jeffrey.
No.  Hi baby.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Here's to Ben.
There ya go.
Be right down.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Good deal Dad.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
What else is new? Right?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
You've got a point there.
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
OK.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Look, it can wait till Sunday.
Actually. I've been in twice.
Yeah. I mean a little, you know.
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yeah.
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
I can't dance fast.
Let's wait for some slow one.
I bounced you on my knee at family reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad and me ran the whole east coast syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. And when you took the wheel, who was beside you?
The Duke?  What did you do?
Go find one.
Look under the body.
Got it.
Where's your gun?
Chest pocket.  Shit!
Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
You gotta keep going.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
I'll call you tonight, afterwards. 
Fuck!
me up the...
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen.
For what?
I'm serious.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
Me, too.
Yes.
Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
I...
You sure you killed them?
Plus where's Huggie Bear?
He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't in every single episode.
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
What does Starsky say?
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
That sets it off.
Just turn right here.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
Well, then cut it in half.
Anthony, we're on the run. This is an emergency. It's only fair that...
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
OK. Go ahead.
True.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
Obviously. That's a given.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Yes... It's true.
That's not correct.
No, Dignan. This isn't --
I did.
Yeah. As a girl.
OK. Roger.
Any activity?
Nobody move!
Get against the wall!
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Dignan, I --
Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK. Pop quiz. What's the single most important aspect of your job?
I'm not really sure. I think it's Irish. Or maybe --
I guess what I'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this Dignan?
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
Absolutely.
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
See you, Bob.
OK, Dad.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
No, I don't mind.
I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
Why do you say that?
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
No.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
So who's going to know?
Let's cut the bullshit.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
You're paranoid, Bob.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
Yeah. One of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
So it's my fault?
There were more than that.
I don't know.
See you in a little while.
What are you talking about?
We'll have to see when we get back.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
I never agreed to that.
That's OK.
Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Wait a second --
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
And what does that cover?
This is no good.
Why did he go that way? 
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
She is a good looking woman.
Will it track back to us?
Save it for Bourne.
I want to know about Treadstone.
...this is Conklin's computer.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
No. You lost your way.
No, I do.
-- my coat -- but we should --
I worry when you get like this.
I should be better by now.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
-- it's just him? --
Yes.
You hear me? I believed you.
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
What do you mean?
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
Who's this?
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
Three, maybe more!
You win.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive they purification... And in the end, I promise you'll beg for the axe.
I will be with you, like this. Forever.
...Tonight!
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
That is not possible.
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
Who would do such a thing?
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Anything.
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
So what did you find.
My father has a bad memory, too?
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Weirder than this?
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Go on. Sit down.
Like how?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Know what?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
And...?
Kayleigh? What happened?
Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
I know, I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
And you are...?
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself, Evan. Nice friends, nice life, not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides, we're here already.
You're such a retard!
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
Yes, sir.
You haven't heard my offer.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
Here's looking at you, kid.
And I was wondering.
Yes?
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Has it got a wow finish?
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
No, not yet.
Everything is quite all right.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
Yes, ma'am.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Won't you join us?
Yes?
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
No, Victor, there isn't.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
Any time.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I said, ask your wife.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Yes.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
Very well.
I slept very well.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
Mademoiselle.
A wise foreign policy.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
I have. Sit down over there.
Put it down!
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
You've had today's water.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
You are.
Yeah.  A long time ago.
Had a package to deliver.
You don't seem too happy about it.
No.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
I'm so glad you're alive.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
That new roof, that's your doing.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Good night, Daddy.
Daddy, *please*...
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
Really?
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
Right.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
Yes, I *have*!
They wanted a girl.
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
But did you know him?
Did you know your mother better?
Liberator...
Migrants?
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
I guess so...
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
I don't think so.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
When will he be home, Major?
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
After you cut her loose.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Two million.
We pay better.
Eight A.M. flight.
You can't cheat an honest man.
Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
I think I just broke my hand.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
Intuition.
Sorry. I'm just... Look what they did to him. Right in the middle of his egg-foo-young.
I'm getting a ride.
What?
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
Do you even remember Al? Do you remember what he looked like sitting there?
With identification.
I'm sorry.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Pretty much.
It's not history.
Confidence. It's just confidence.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
It's just insurance.
No. Thanks.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Not particularly.
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
I want to hear it.
You've got such beautiful hands.
Why not?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
You will?
Really?
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not.
You don't like cheats, do you.
Let it go.
I have to take the car.
Jack! It's Jani.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Who did it? Tell me!
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Nice car.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
Jack.
I said good call.
How?
Very impressive.
I can see.
She was a real asset. But what could I do?
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
Where's the fail-safe key?
Time to start talking.
All right, then...
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
Talby, can you read me?
All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
Of course.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Right!
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
So if you detonate in...
You have no proof that it was correct data.
Yes.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
What?
-- Remark.
You'll have plenty of time for that, you know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we've only aged three, so there'll be plenty of time to stare around...
What happened, Doolittle?
No kidding?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Well, what you might try is --
Phenomenology...
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
What're you talkin' about?
How come I never hearda you before?
Trying to have a relationship with you, Max, is like standing in a fog bank.  You know you're in the middle of something only you have absolutely no idea where you are.
I see the perimeter defense system is still fully intact... At least I tried.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
Yech...
They took my daughter.
Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
First time I ever heard that.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Too early to tell.
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Something.
Is the social studies class over for today?
Yeah...
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
Bent.
C'mere, I want to show you something.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
A girl.
Your basic hodge-podge.
Your help.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
But she does work here?
I need to talk to her.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
A little what?
How long you and me known each other?
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Does this person have a name?
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
How'd you get her out of town?
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Got any KISS?
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Weird...
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Nah. Couldn't be.
I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Go ahead, Jam.
You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon.
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Was it a teddy?
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Let's lift up her shirt.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Yeah.
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
Theoretically.
Like a spear.
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
You know what? I think that you did it.
You have to do something for me first.
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
School's cancelled.
Fuck them.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
Hey. You OK?
It's safe here.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
His name is Frank.
I asked you about school.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
Do you feel alone right now?
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Why would I tell Mom?
What I think is going on with your son.
There's no rule!
Where is she?!
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Here, have some.
I know.
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
Okay. Take her purse.
All right, then.
Oh yah-sure, I know what some of your big city, no bra wearin', hairy- legged women's libbers say, "Pageants are old-fashioned" and, uh, and "demeaning" to the girls --
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Yeah.
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
Becky was my only shot at state!
Oh, my!  Hello, Father Donigan! Sidewalks, sidewalks?
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Don't make me kick-ya where the good Lord split-ya.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
"My dear President"...
None of your business...  Take another letter.
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
I don't call him, I whistle.
I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Then I demand an apology!
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
I don't know about us, but I know he's-a got something...
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
I can't do it right away.
If any form of pleasure is exhibited Report to me and it will be prohibited.  I'll put my foot down; So shall it be - This is the land of the free.  The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it. 
$50?
And Vera niece, too.
No... it was a seven letter word.
Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
Let him patch up his own breeches...
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
How lovely.
Oh, yes.
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
Steady on, Treves. Have a seat.
What a mess.
Oh, no.
Alas, no.
No, but I certainly shall.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
How awful for John.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Yes.
No, nothing.
Thank you... very much.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
John... Merrick
You did not ask me.
Not at all, John.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
There is one more thing, John. Here.
Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
A dressing bag?
Well...
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Those things in your hands.
It was different...
What was she like?
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
And I thought you said it was something special...
Goodbye, Aud...
The second note to wake the Gods...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
You've got to let me go!
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Don't talk nonsense.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
What?
I know!
What?
Well, you ARE!
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
What "magic"?
Now stop it!
Trust me to get the missionary.
No! Arrgh!
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
I don't want to have to sit next to Snorri all that time.
We haven't got a spare place.
Yeah... well...
Do what?
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Oh...
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
It's not my business any more!
I know, Dad.
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
Not now, Sven...
You liar!
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
I did. You said, things were fine.
And I just liked you so much.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
Okay, I guess.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
You're sure? It's cold.
Sort of, um...
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
What?
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Thanks.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Yeah.
Yeah? Oh, great!
When?
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Let's talk about it later.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Yeah.
Naomi, I guess.
And I didn't have an argument.
Yeah?
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Okay.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Oddly enough, I do.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Long day thinking.
That's your look for me.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
What?
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Yeah.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
'Night.
'kay.
Order me a pastrami for after?
Well, thank you, Mary.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
Then check the connections.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
Don't start with me, Cooper.
Can you shut it down?
Hurry.
One thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. Start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, Christ, he's bleeding out...
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
Frozen.
...you okay?
Justin.
That's what we're here to find out.
Better if I just show you.
Yes, sir.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
We don't have time to fart.
They're gone.
Understood.
Keep your eyes open.
We can take the filters from the Clark...
We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
I'm trying, goddammit --
I don't think this is a good idea, we don't even know what happened on that ship...
The forward airlock.
Relax, it's casual.
I mean...
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
I should have done more, run more tests --
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Front page?
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Sue... look at your hands.
No, I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
Not at all.
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
You can't leave them out there.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
This is how I dress all the time.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
They're not home yet.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Well... it's true.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Dad says!
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
Get a ride with somebody.
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I guess I did.
All right, I take it back.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Yeah?
Ace the jacket.
All right. Pay attention.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
Whatever you say, Rat.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
I've been swimming, Merv.
That's me, Merv.
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
Naw. Any good?
This ain't no cop.
What should I do?
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Well I never did it.
There's nothing to it.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
Not since November.
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I want romance.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
What's that?
If you graduate.
You're gonna flunk me?!
All right, the point it is.
What about those other guys you live with?
No. I mean back to your home.
Two more Cokes.
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Well... it's getting kind of late.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Well, thank you.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
What do you mean by that?
Las Vegas.
That's a fine combination. You can't lose.
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
No, no. Don't leave me!
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
Can we make it?
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
Are you ready?
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
NO! Stop talking like that.
Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Part of what?
They'll get in! We'll all die!
With what just happened upstairs --
Where's that?
Hey!
Shit!
Anybody else?
Well...
Huh?
Holds four.
No bullshit.
Clear!
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
Move slow and move quiet.
I'm fine! I'm fine!
All right.
I think --
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
You see: We've got to change that name.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
...acts. I'll relay your message.
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Thank you.
Who is she?
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
I know, but --
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Dick...
No?
...Don't you?
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
Thank you.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
You sound as if you hate it.
No, I don't hate it.
Don't touch me.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
Yeah, well --
Enh.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
Think I'll have a glass.
I'll bet.
What?
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I hope so, Frances.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
Run!
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
'Golden Boy.'
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
It's your fan mail, little sister.
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
I was watching.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
This was not taken from a grave.
I will not! Kill me now!
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
The world is a dizzying place.
I'll have to do better than that.
Not as weak as I.
I give you my soul...
I've no choice
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
No. But someday.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
No. They don't.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
What is your name?
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
I guess...
You told her to sweep the courts.
I finished the boats.
I don't know.
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
God, but I love that sexy talk.
There you are dead wrong.
Sure.
You said it was just you and your son.
What about Kate?
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't do nothin' stupid.  You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!
Auto wreck.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with this shit.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Why not, against your religion?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
Kate, Scott?
Not good enough, swear to God.
No!
What's in Mexico?
In the morning, darlin', in the morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through hell, and I know I've been one rough pecker, but from here on end you guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says, "Digayo." When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down for a few miles, then you see a bar called "The Titty Twister." From what I hear, you can't miss it.
Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
I'm really sorry.
Later.
I'm by myself today, ate my lunch outta the microwave.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
What? Are you kidding? I didn't do anything!
You believe me don't cha?
Gotcha!
What'd ya see?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
Really?
What?
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
Yeah.
I'm fine, sir.
So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
No, sir, WHAT?
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Sir?  What did he say?
No problem, sir!
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
I was one member of the investigating commission.
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Uh, ma'am.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
I'd go Special Reconnaissance. Every bit as tough -- and we have a 60 percent drop-out rate among the men.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
Don't you know?  How they're talking about you?
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
Whose orders were those?
Made it to Week 10 last time.
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
Good to see you again, too, sir.
We are so fucked.
So am I.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook.  but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it.  A man-in-place.  Makes everything very controllable.
Me!? You where the one...
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Really? I'd like to find out.
Well, I think you're cute.
I don't think so.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
We've met before.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
...Damn you!  Damn you!
I heard something. A squeal.
Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
A boy comes to the door.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  The bowels of the ship.
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
I'm just a glorified extra, Fred.  I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
I think he just likes pointing at things.
You smiled at me.
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Turn on the translation circuit.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
We.. We lie.
As you wish.
You... You mean Earth?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Anything.
Okay, let's go.
It doesn't have eyes.
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
You seem pleased by the prospect.
And a French alliance?
It comes down to leaders.  If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die?  The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation.
Then, I need you.  We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all.
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
Couldn't you have appealed to Congress?
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
Yes, general?
No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I.  But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact.
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
Again, just to touch on a touchy subject, but... would the people accept another leader over Washington?
The British Army is right back there, across that river!  Sir!  I think it must be something else that detains General Lee.
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
The man is a traitor!
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court.
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Martha!  For God's sake!
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
That's good... who?
I see...
Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions?  Because each of us is who we are:  we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change.  The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us.  And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Who?
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
Farrah. Come here.
Yayo. Where is he?
You gave him the money?
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
Okay. So who are you?
Look at me, Ray.
That's correct. Look at me.
So what brings you to L.A., Bones?
Don't insult me. Get up and turn around.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
I'm a producer.
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Well, since Leo's name was on the passenger list...
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
What's it called?
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
I'm thinking of a movie.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
What if it was?
...That's what we finally decided.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Don't go out of your way.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
You're as bad as Harry...
Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I thought that was... I'm so sorry...
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
That's where you got the idea?
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Shylock?
And after all, you have such morals.
Lemme see.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Wrong. It's Friday.
What?
Maureen.
How long, then?
Three, four days.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Yeah, yeah.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
You smashed it!
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
If money can buy what he wants.
Right.
Probably didn't have time.
She was sailing up north, right?
Did you see him?
What guy?
Are you sure?
Yup.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Not our mystery guest again.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there, the next she was gone.
Either of you seen Dodge?
Maybe it was more than that.
I think I see it pretty well.
Dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
We could call for help.
Moving to Sweden.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
And look what happened.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
Or what?
Guess.
Give up?
Maxine.
What?
Yeah, I heard about that.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Uh-oh.
Well, yes...
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you.  I had to give it to someone else...  But I'm sure next year I can --
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
Oh my God, that's HIM!
I just stopped in to say hi.
What do you mean "why"?
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Why not?
That lets us off the hook.
What does that even mean?
I remember every minute of that party.
Which loser?
Oh yeah.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
What are you talking about?
Fuck you, bitch!
"Hassle"?
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
It's a surprise.
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
Wait...
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
What thing?
Do you still want to do something tonight?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
What time?
Just because.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Shhh!
How much is this?
Umm... That's not officially for sale... I might have to hang onto that for the time being.
Who does?
I know it's over, asshole, I --
That's not even --
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
I'm totally serious!
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
I really didn't get a good look at her.
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
What, are you a klansman or something?
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
So, what happened?
Jesus, Enid... I'll talk to you later... bye!
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Sounds good...
I... I don't know. I don't really think I should...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
I'm just being realistic.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
But, I...
I don't know.
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
What are you talking about?
-you do not call me a liar- you know nothing of their health- consider yourself fortunate I persuaded so many to stay- consider yourself fortunate I have decided to stay-
As are they all.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
You've never built in Africa.
But overall, you're pleased?
Yes he is.
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
We all worked together. Worthy deeds were accomplished. I liked the labor.  My mother insisted on piano lessons- broke the dear woman's heart when I turned out to be tone deaf- but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands.  I like the blood, is that strange?
That's very considerate.
Have you ever failed?
But of course yours worked.
Thank you, Samuel.
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Oh yes. But it takes time.
Once... 
Underneath.  Somewhere.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.

I command you.
Did I forget something?
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
From where -- Neptune?
Do it!  Just do it!
No, the slime is rising.
Oh, hiya, Pete.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
No, I just thought --
And decent.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
Uuuuuuugh!!
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
All right, what happened to me?
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I'll scream.
Then leave.
You're the best one in your row.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
Die in what sense?
In the physical sense.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
Then my theory was correct.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Yeah, I can smell it.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Does she want to be?
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
That appears to be the case.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
Fourteen hundred.
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
Me, too.
Do you believe in God?
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
What are you talking about?
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
Not yet, dear brother...
Send them out!
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
I hope you live to see what I believe...
You're hearing about somebody else.
You don't know how wrong you are.
Why you?
That's what worries me...
Yours will do!
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
What deal?
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Think about it!  Just think about it!
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
Yes, I do.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
At the Zoo.
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
Oh.
Yes.
Because -- I am.
What did she say?
Because it isn't true.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
I don't understand.
Goodbye.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
You mean you're confused?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Oh no. He said that.
The day after tomorrow?
Yes, sir.
Ahhh.
Could I make one phone call first?
Yes.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Whatever you say, sir.
What?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Will you unzip my dress?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
But they would! Don't you see?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Very well. Thank you.
Waiter!
Now?
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Well -- goodbye then --
To tell you?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
Is this -- what?
On your first time --
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
INADEQUATE!
Anything. Anything at all.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
No.
What?
There!
Now let's keep going here.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Oh my God.
Don't talk about Elaine?
Then let's hear them.
I wouldn't know.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Did I say that?
But it's not.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Then give me your word you won't.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
How?
I don't believe you.
What the hell have you done?
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
You don't?
Well --
I know.
Quite a while.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Mr. Robinson?
Why?
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
And what are you going to do?
The pearls are in her room.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Need any help?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Free --
Why do you hide in my room?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
I want to be alone.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
Yes.
You do believe that I really love you?
Shall I see you again?
Very early in the morning.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
No -- not at all.
All right then.
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Well -- last night was not so good.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat! 
No, doctor.
Oh -- but -- I --
You are ill.
But Doctor --
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
Yes.
I never danced before -- in public.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
No -- now.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
Well?
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Oh, yes.
Well, he's a gentleman!
We did not approach you.
And I said we didn't.
Next week.
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Why not?
You haven't time.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
What -- what is it? Last night...
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
I could not think of not accepting.
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
You expect me to buy this?
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
You want a drink?
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
What? He's going to be all right!
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Oh, sure. Fine.
How come?
Get off the grift, Roy.
You don't have the stomach for it.
No. That was the point.
As though you do what I say.
Just a few bucks.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
You're too young. You should be in school.
In your other hand.
We'll rent a car.
Where?
What?  What for?
) If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
I'm happy the way I am.
) What?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Happy to see you looking so good.
It's for your cigarette.  I prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
The cemetery...
Carter.
Funny, we just drove right in.
My god...
What the fuck are you talking about?
Would somebody shut this guy up?
Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
Nothing.
Afraid not.  You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Just get on the bus.
Please, get on the bus...
Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
Then you come out here.
Alright.  I'll come out.  Just be quiet.
Here, take my jacket.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
Can't you?
I did alright.
You're unbelievable.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
We can light our own tree at home.
He says things.  Bad things.
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
But surely Rogers isn't --
Retiring.
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
I'll meet you over there.
Jamie's baby ...
Samhain.
Hm?
No.
How all the magazines show tits today.
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
The hell with the diamonds!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
In what way, pray tell?
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
You never played a violin.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
For what?
To make an ass of yourself.
Gee whiz--
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
They were in the same creative writing class.
It makes life spicy.
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
Mhravitch.
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Sir?
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Beat the shit out of someone who hates you.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Situation.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
And he keeps it in his apartment?
What are you going to do?
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Did you like it, dear?
Unless she has nerve.
Almost a Christmas scene.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
Rifle?
Honor, I suppose.
No.
Stop!
There has to be a threat of some sort, nobility of some sort, glamour of some sort, sport of some sort.  These elements are lacking.
Do it, Norbert.
Ooops.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
She's fine.  Please--
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye.
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
I'm going to shoot you now.
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Don't shoot.
How horrible.
I don't want to live any more.
I feel like I want to yell my head off--just yell anything.  Bulllllllllllllll-dickey!
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
Then who flushed the toilet?
What?
It's jungle rot!  This room is making everybody sick!  This is your family doctor speaking now.  Here--I brought you something else to hang on your wall, for the sake of variety.
I'll get ready, Herb.  I didn't expect you this soon.  Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
That's something I suppose.
Something happens to my confidence.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
Yeah.
Is he all right?
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
Marry me instead.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
Take plenty of cigars.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
What kind of a life is that?
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
I'm amazed.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
We've got to rescue him.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
I said I hope she's a runaway. Better that than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. These are realities.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Well, I want to...
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Wait?
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Yeah.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
You know what I'm talking about.
Say what?
They were here?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Grand Rapids? Of course.
But what?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
But then you'll forget about me.
You are.
Yeah.
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
Where is she?
No.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Hmm.
Get out!
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
I just heard. Who is he?
How did you find me?
What?
What is going on?
What will I tell the others? They care about you.
Where!
No.
Let's go.
It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Huh?
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Officer, I can explain.
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
No.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Promise?
Eh, fine.
Me! No. Of course not.
No. 
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
It's so blue.
With God?
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
To whom?
What?
No. My uncle.
Ah, yes.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
What else do you like?
Well, maybe one.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
I see.  Were you happy at school, Harold?
Yes.
Eh?
How about to slit his throat?
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Oh yes. That's fine.
Yes.
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. Says it's helping to bring her out.
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Go on. But trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in Hell.
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Don't worry about fingerprints. I never had any.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
-- Hound of resurrection?
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Oh, I'll bet you have.
From where??!!
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Oh, stop that --  Damn! Be careful, there --
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart."
What are you trying to say?
Yup.
Hey. You: think twice --
Shh! Just a second.
Not from you.
My fucking hand!
Sure.
Who are you?
Many times.
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here.
Not know.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Let me see.
Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
There's very little I can do about it.
I have to see my father.
So damn stupid.
Sure.
Fine.
Please...
Please.
I'm already way over my usual limit. You know, it's funny. I feel like I've known you for years.
Maybe I will.
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
I'll get the doctor.
Try me.
Daddy?
I love you too.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Gone?
Yes!
No. It's all over.
It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
Just upstairs.
It's late.
She's so damn... English.
Your father told me you were working here.
Long time ago.  I was just thinking about her.  I was her first boyfriend.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker?  You're going soft in your old age, Rob.  There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street.  Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy.  You're right, Rob.  I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Oh come on, Rob.  What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick?  What rational explanation can there possibly be?  What's her name?
You're not even coming?
We're getting that anyway.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
You'd love it!
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Nice friend.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
I understand, Dick.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Well stay for tonight, then.
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
You really believe that?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Yeah.  Great.
You won't like it.
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
You know I'm a good person.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
I can't talk right now.
In a minute.  When I get it together.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
Harder.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Not really.
I mean it.
No.  Probably not.
Fair enough.
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
I understand completely.
Oh, right.  Alright.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Sixty.
Thirteen hundred.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Go to hell.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
And you?
You?
No.
Are you?
You are.  Now.
It will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to Gettysburg.
There's a catch.  You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing.
Why are you here?
I see.
That would be difficult to explain.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
What is it you want?
No!
Thanks.
-Auditorium nostrum-
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
Why are you here?
You are still so very young.
You will live.  Survive.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
Aye.
But we cannot be killed.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
I'll be back when I can.
I don't understand.  Not a week ago your father gave us his blessing.
Some think not.
Something pretty.
Far away.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Thanks.
He knows I'm here.  How?
He always did.
I've had a few more concerns.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Leave her out of this.
I have waited forever for this. You will not cheapen it, little boy.
I want you to come to me.
Yes.
American.
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Hildy!
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
But --
I'm sure you haven't any.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Did you finish the interview?
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Where'd she go?
Out some place.
Thank you.
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
Hello, Hildy!
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
I have a lunch date. I just want --
Sure you can. Come on.
You've had a better offer, eh?
You bet I've got a better offer.
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
You've got to help me, Hildy.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
We're not interested.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
You'll get it. Now what's the story?  I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
She jumped out of the window.
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
What tickets?
Railroad tickets.
I'm finished.
Finished!
Louie!
Was she? Did you notice?
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
Yes.
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Where'd you wire him?
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Who do you want?
I'm busy, Duffy.
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
You said it!
All right -- all right!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Not this gun!
What?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff.
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Go on -- shoot me!
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
Huh?
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
That man there!
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
I won't, Earl. 
Put down that gun, Earl.
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
Keep away!
How'd you get here, Earl?
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
Wait a minute, Mollie.
How much do you make a week?
Huh?
The what?
The City Sealer's office!
I know.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
What's that?
...and six...
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
You joined up.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
After this dance.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
Play something, Grace.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
What about R.J.?
Where's that?
Oh yeah, the tree.
OK.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
OK.
A dead one.
That's not something to joke about.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
Yeah, no shit.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
He won't move.
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
What?
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
You find something, Georgie?
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly, do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?
No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
No, just a little too old.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
Let's go see.
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Shit... fuck procedure.
Yes, sir.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
That must be him.
Gabrielle.
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Gabby, what is it?
Urgh.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
Don't be silly!  And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."
I don't know.
Oui.
We still have you and I.
You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
Okay. If you think it will help.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
Three foot one.
Be still my crotch.
Yeah. My brother told me.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
I'm sorry?
No biggie.
Nathan!
Of course.
What SPF, sweetie?
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
What?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Nothing. Be right out.
Your entire body?
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
It would just be helpful to know.
No.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Yes.
Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Got it.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Yep.
Mm hmm.
No.
No, I'm fine.
To win.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
It's possible.
Twelve thousand.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
Pool.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
Why?
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Thinking about what?
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
Hey, whaddya say something like that for?
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
You want me to tell her for you?
Well, here it's half.
You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Now and then. Why, do you?
For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
How much are you ahead?
Okay, friend. You're on.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
What bus?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Hey!
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Thanks.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
Oh, it's not bad.
What's this supposed to mean?
What's it so hot in here for?
He's a gambler.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
I'll be up later.
I'm a little tired.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
I hear you've been looking for me.
Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
Hundred dollars?
Preach... get it at Johnny's.  You got a bet.
No.
You lived like this once.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
Do we have to?
Was there anything over the hill?
About what?
You people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... What sort of training do you have anyway?
No.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
What?
All right.  I'll be right back.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
David, don't...
A toast to the end of the world.
Did it work?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
What'd I say?
But Mr. President...
ETA with target; four minutes.
Yes, Sir.
Better than we thought.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
It had been deemed classified.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
Dick-weed!
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
I said call them back.
The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
I'll tell him we'll take two.
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
You could be more right than you know.
We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
I knew it was you --
I usually don't.
Are you sure?
Uh-huh.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
My father didn't want it incinerated.
Junior!
She talks in her sleep.
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
And the chair.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
Dad, we're well out of range.
You call this archaeology?
No camels!
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
You should have been there...
No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the present Maharajah's late father.
Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty.
Just a statue.
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie.
Long ago -- before my father's father.
They say we must pray to their evil god. We say we will not.
Siam? But I'm not dressed for Siam...
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
The old man saw it in a dream.
It's pulling me deeper!
What?!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
I know the feeling...
Oh really?
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
You're talking to an authority in that area.
Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE!
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
Yes.
No... they won't kill me.
You got it!
You're not gonna believe this...
This candid camera?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Right.
Kill myself.
You're not crazy.
Why don't you?
Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
We have to get out of here.
Just walk down the hall?
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
We get on which plane?
Oh yeah, to what?
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Where are you going? Wait!
She's beautiful...! What do I do?
She doesn't seem to understand.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
How do you know?
This just won't work.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
I was afraid of that.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
Aim what?
About what?
Now, you're too suspicious.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Aren't we all.
It'll remind me of you.
Don't give her your name.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
Join us.
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
Well...I try to give them whatever they want.
What things?
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Do what?
Who...are you?
Well what?
I feel fine.
You'll feel better
Who?
Been hearing voices.
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
Let you leave without it.
You did.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Hires you for what?
They kidded me a little.
No.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
You think I'm like that?
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
I asked him.
You've  been there?
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something.
Why'd you invite me here?
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
You can't take that.
Why not?
The experiment. The danger...
It is?
Leaving, now go to sleep. ...all of you.
It will.
How long?
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Well, it's authoritative and is overwhelmingly documented.
What I mean is, like, how does it cut through the confidentiality agreement?
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
Okay. Hold on a second... What is it?
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what?
Catch ya' later.
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
Catch you later.
You ready...?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Right now?
Thomas Sandefur...
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
They're killing the Wigand interview...
What?!
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
Area code 212-555-0199.
That's right...
Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
I'm with Don on this.
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
It's obvious, isn't it?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Tempura...
Yes.
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
I don't think you really understand --
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the complaint...  Any other questions?
ABC...?
I told the truth... I told the truth.
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
You called me.
Where you staying now?
You're gonna get your fix...
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
Object to the form!
There an echo in here? Your objection's been recorded. She typed it into her little machine over there. It's on the record. So now I'll proceed with my deposition of my witness. Does it act as a drug?
How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition...
They hate each other --
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
No...
What the hell is Botox?
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
Oh. I thought maybe --  Gee!
What?
So, that's good, right?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
I was a hostess. For Trans-World Airlines.
He manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. He's very successful.
No.
You don't believe in it.
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She didn't love you?
Oh right. You met Patricia.
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Do you want to sleep on it?
Yes. Again.
I know.
I have a watch.
Oh Miles!
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
May I come in?
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
I want to nail you ass.
What kind of "stuff?"
Those are gifts.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Are you alright? You lost weight.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
I wish I had your discipline.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
Mm.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
Well -- is that possible?
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
Miles.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Muriel Rumsey.
I've put extra men on, all along the way.
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
Oh, no, sir. No different than
Yeahwith all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
Do you love her?
You ought to know why. Because
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
Why should she? After all
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statementthat you've had a talk with methat we've reached an understandingthat if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Sock her!
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
What happened to your money?
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
What am I going to do now?
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
The pleasure is all mine.
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Like this. I have no robe.
Heretake mine.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
No. No. It's too good a story.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
Next week "East Lynne."
How about Cinderellaor a real hot love story?
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
You're crazy.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
What!
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
Hitch-hiking.
Carrots.
Raw?
You're an expert, I suppose.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Come on! come on! 
A black eye. 
Nope.
Won't I ever see you again?
In about fifteen minutes.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
Get out!
Oh, excuse me. 
Just your imagination.
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Yeah? Where?
Yeah.
I'd put you there myself.
Well, I'll be
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
Collect.
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Oh!!
That's right.
What's on your mind?
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
You love them, don't you?
Al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close.  Goddamn, Sam!  If we don't start reading between the lines here! Y'all gotta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does. We're through the looking glass. Here white is black and black is white.
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
There were no phone records.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
Keep saying what?
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
So why does he call himself Bertrand?
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
How could I forget?  You make quite a first impression.  Sharon, could you please bring us some coffee?  I've heard over the years you're quite a first-rate pilot, Dave. Legend has it you can get in and out of any field, no matter how small...  I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you know.  Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war.
No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
What was so appealing about Houston?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for awhile.  I got to make some calls.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
What?
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
I wouldn't imagine where.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
Nonsense.  What next?
Now just a minute, sir!  You're way out of line!
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
What?
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published...
...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
Don't get me started on that.  Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin' gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's gonna tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned bookstore.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
Ever ask him?
You have other information?
Was he there often?
Yeah!  That's it.  I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I gotta go.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
Six.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
Are you kidding, it looks great. You wear this to a business meeting, you're the badass in the room. But you can go out dancing in this too. It's a total power suit.
Oh, that's not a problem.
I know. That's why I went.
Who?
Uh-huh.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
How'd you know where he was?
Sure.
That's my diet shit.
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Can I see your I.D.?
Why does it need to be dark?
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Ordell pick up his bond?
No, you didn't. What branch?
He's got that kinda money?
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Who is this?
He called you?
What?... What'd you do?
Why?
It's not really something I think about.
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
"American President"
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
You think he's got a thing for you?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
Why?
Did you do it that night?
More or less.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
Less ten percent.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
Madrid or Barcelona?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
He say is a surprise.
If I'm working, I can help you.
You ever see him sell guns?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
I thought you were watching him.
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
He told me to go outside.  "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
Kinda.
Keep it between us girls?
Do you got something for me?
They asked.
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
I do okay.
Didja tell 'em anything else?
Who?
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
Sure.
Uh-huh.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Did you ever go I one?
You live with him.
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
This one.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
What's your relationship?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
So you're sure she's dead.
We went to the parking lot.
Or...  ...she gave it to somebody else first, before Melanie went in the dressing room.
Tell me.
Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
I got some more business for ya.
What?
Did the police contact you?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit.
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
Git your ass in here.
Winston found you.
In a way, yes.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
Take me home.
What are you then?
No, thanks.
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
I'm hanging up.
It's cold.
I don't have to do any such thing. I'm eating my lunch, okay?
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
Not my head, buddy. Not me. I'm gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
I say you should get a shrink.
I saw Sarah the other day.
A bit.
Wiggle your toes.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
I haven't seen her in months.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
But I see them.
I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
We better get an orthopedic man in here. Is Dr. Davis on call?
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Where'd you leave 'em?
Did you look around the headboard?
What?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
Why? What for?
Coming here?
You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
I want to know. You tell me!
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
Sit down.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
You can have anything you want.
Where are they?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
You know who I am.
It's strong stuff.
Well that's good to know.
I no from around here.
Total delirium.
Total delirium.
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
You've seen them?
Everywhere, like a plague.
Is he all right?
Oh, come on!
We don't have time to argue!
Sergeant? We thought you were...
He....He...
Two more charges to go.
I don't know!
I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
But I didn't see...
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
Were you close to your father?
You?
Okay, good tip.
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
I think so, why?
Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
She needs a little time.
Close the fucking door!
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Maybe she tripped.
Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
I love you.
I gotta go back.
See you then . . . doctor.
Hockey player? He's not a ...
Old Earth?
What have I done?! Idiots.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
You got it.
Don't tell me my business!  Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
He's taken him!
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
He's sitting in it.
Michael! Come inside!
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want.  You want to come?
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
You could say that.
What do we do?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Y'know, I used to hate the water...
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
Think she might've run out on you?
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing.
What else could've done that?
So would I. Come on in.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
I'm okay...
Fasten the pole.
He's under!
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
I just hope you don't consider her a close friend.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
I don't like Katrina.
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
No...
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Can we make out now?
Okay.
What a trip, man.
Excuse me?
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
When was this, like '96?
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
Oh.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
No?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
You're pregnant?
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
Right, seriously.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Eww, he's all beardy!
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here.
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
Aren't you the cool guy?
I suppose anything's possible.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
...Yeah, sure.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
So you don't do any of those things.
Could I try that?
Hold still.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
No sir.
Damn right I do.
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Lighten up...
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
She told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Not yet.
Listen, Eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
Where's Adele?
She wasn't feeling so good.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
Who are you?
Where would we find him?
...That'd be my guess.
17.
You're clean.
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
She can fuck?
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
You mean like fucking two virgins at once.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
You think?
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Yeah me too nigga.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
He looks like my uncle.
Who?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Yeah. She's only 13.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
Shut the fuck up.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Why not? You stink.
Where you goin' tonight?
You sure?
Yeah, watch where you walk dukes.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Right now?
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
Tonight?
I like you too.
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
One.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Everything is wrong.
No.
Passion...
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Yeah?
Do you know where he went?
I no understand you. Maybe crazy.
Yep.
It's like...
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
Yeah I get bored.
Yeah.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
He still does.
Nah.
I don't know, eight or nine.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
It's very monotonous.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
Fine, don't ask me out on a date.
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
It's a voice modulator.
He's one of the best Chess players in the world.  Who better to play a game with?
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
You'll find her.
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
How?
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
Very nice speech, Peter.  Did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  There's an old wooden bench in the garden.  Next to it is a rock.  You'll find a message for you under it.  Let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
Very good.
What word did you leave last night?
They think that you and I are doing this together.
I've figured out the message.
Please... wait.
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
You don't understand.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Come here.
Six, eight hours tops.
No prints.
Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
That's great.
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
Through a rental agency.
Only in passing.  To say hello to.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- He could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
Then I'll transpose.
You don't win by playing it safe, Peter.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
You.
Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Let's change the subject.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
You mean like in the steam room?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
Does anyone?
Where's the note?
Because I know what it says.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
No he didn't.
Never mind my ears! Go away!
I can't.
Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
I will find her!
But you suspect.
You will know, in good time.
Can she be forced?
Yes. To keep her from you. But now that we are inside the Fortress, you will be able to contact her.
She can see the Beast!
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
My <u>friend</u>.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
I am Quell.
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
Yes.
I knew.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
He leads a group of Slayers, under the leopard banner.
No. They are sad, solitary creatures, rarely seen.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
Yeah.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Well, I don't need them...
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
How can you say it?
OK.
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
Too heavy.
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
...I got lost, Mister.
Fine...
...Composer.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
Huh? Why?
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
...Even his mother wouldn't.
I don't accept that.
She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Thank you.
Don't wait by the phone.  If he's really been walking this whole time, he's out of our jurisdiction...
You need a ride, Preacher?
Yes -- you are.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
What it is -- is the truth.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
That's a reasonable assumption.
Red flag, man.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
Not our problem.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
This guy's not a murderer.
If he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses.
Maybe.
It has to be a full character's name.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
Why know?
What Mr. Parker?
Saluting.
I do.
...Noooo.
Of course.
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
You OK out there?
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Don't be silly?
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
Yes... I'll give you that.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Do I look that obvious? My name's Paul.
What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
Sort of.
Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
Who's askin'?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
Spill.
Is she as pretty as you?
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
No.
What's the point?  Look at me.
How'd it go at the trial?
You know her?
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Thank you. I love you, too.
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish.
No way --
I will...
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability.
But maybe it is --
Maybe not to your face...
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
So Friday at eight?
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Why not?
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
So are you!
Of course.
No.
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Now I am.
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
You should glory in your animal nature.  It is your triumph!  None know that better than I!
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Why have you brought me here?
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
And if I cannot?
What does she want from me?
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Something the matter?
There's the way, mates.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
There isn't much time!
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Did you bring me here to sup?
Patience, lad.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
Liar!
A gentleman would offer water.
I'll go search for it.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Oh, la...
I have no wife.
You've freed me, Jack...
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
Sunlight?
That's why he goes masked during the day...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
I can't see a thing.
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
Not very precise directions.
Ask away, sweet man.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
I think she's about to foal.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
A castle's but stone and mortar --
What's wrong?
Oh God, we don't want the police!
Are you his friend?
Why?
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
Where to?
He jumped into the ocean.
We're not gonna do anything.
Does everything have to have a point?
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
He's at work while I'm here.
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
Oh, yes.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
I'm not.
Maybe that's too long.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
You're here early today.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
To check up on me?
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'm not going!
Mom...please.
Why?
You're so predictable.
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
I don't know.
A friend of yours is here.
No.
Nothing.
Getting high, I guess.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
She seemed upset.
Are you taking them still?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
I haven't been touched in years.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I want you to find someone for me.
I don't let him.  He just loves to.
It's okay.
She's a little sad, is all.
Where is he?
Why does he have a lock on his door?
But you can't call me while you think?
Not for the weekend.  For the summer.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
What?
I used to live here.
He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore.  I'd hate to have them bored.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Peter left me yesterday.
Does Alyssa know?
I could use the money.
I know.
I never asked for more.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
I don't know what I'm doing.
She's doing just fine.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Sure, boss.
Claude Banks.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
Start your job? What kind of job?
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
You lost all our money in a card game?
My daddy's watch. This is the dude I was telling you about --
Come on, Ray, better get Winston back to the truck.
Why are you always talking about we? There is no we. There is a me, there is a you. But there is no we between us.
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
Damn straight. I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that.
Make 'em throw strikes.
That was five years ago.
Hey, there's Wilkins!
Well, Ruth shoulda built it a little better. Damn thing's falling to pieces. Gonna hurt somebody.
So?
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
I try to moisturize regularly.
Judge gave 'em the long ride.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
I prefer bourbon.
Well, fortunately, I carry my own.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
You should have come by last night, Radio. You woulda had yourself some fun.
What are you in for, Willie?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
Noon...
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
My mom wasn't a goat?
That pain is hunger.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
What was it called, sir.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
Oh, would you grow up.
That way.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
My dad's an optometrist.
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Are you dead?
Why would you be floating?
Yes...
..."The Devil?"...
I have to, Valerie.
That was Cassius!
Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Anything to eat?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Just the face.
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Did you?
When do you go up?
Please... No.
He was killed.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
I didn't say that I would run... I just...
You're sure you don't want to try?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Then the answer's yes...
No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
Things change!
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
And Sanctuary?
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
I don't know... but it does.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Pile in.
What?
How I remember them. Not necessarily the way they happened.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
I don't know.
It's me...
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Me, too.
I'll call you again.
Are you positive he knows?
Why are ya goin' so early?
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Alice?
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
You were asleep when I got home, yes.
Two detectives are coming out.
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
I'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... Good lookin' blonde? She stayed in the car?...
Who is this?
Sure.
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
YOU'RE SORRY!!
I'll dispatch a convoy to meet him.
All right, all right. Keep quiet.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
I'm thinking.
Certainly not!
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
Goodness, no!
We follow many.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
He amputated his own leg?
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
No porters here!!
No.
Yes.
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Mine?
Don't talk nonsense. Give me the bottle.
Yes, Bob.
See that spot?
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Why - I'm sorry - but I
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
Oh, George . . .
The clothes?
Why aren't you registered through our office?
We'd be eternally grateful if you
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
Why?
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
English!
Go? Where?
Yes.  Barney!
Please don't go.
Hesitated, sir.
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
What happens if I say no?
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
But not a BUG bug-- it's an insect.
She didn't even know you. .
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
A what?
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
Where to?
The radio show?
The Pentagon.
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
I haven't been training a partner -- I've been training a replacement.
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
Do have any idea what I just said?
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Cause I think we're looking at it.
Wait-- listen--
Fine.  Good.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
Then who was he?
And replace them with new ones.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Yes, sir.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Run the subscription list...
From solar position, Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
Did he close the front door?
What?
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
They don't belong to anybody.
Uh, I'll try...
It's a little late for that.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
I was looking for you...
The precogs were wrong.
Who said I would?
What the fuck is going on?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
Tell me!
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
You're insane or you think I am.
Sean --
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
My God...
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
I don't understand --
Precog Deja Vu...
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
We used to, every summer.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
Tell me how all this works.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
Thank you, sir.
He's okay.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
You wanna get us busted? If Max found out you were turning tricks --
No more.
I love you. Come home.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Go.
How could you let her see this?
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
There's no touching.
I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
I don't get it.
Well, you look it. You win?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
You driving her?
She'll be out in a minute.
Excuse --
What's his name?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
We meet at the Globe on Park Avenue at six forty-five. I'll see you then.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
You bet the ponies?
This one?
No.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
Bobby.
No. That's cool, man.
Any time, bro.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
Ask if he said anything to her.
I will.
Sorry coach.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Seat belt.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
I'll get the girl.
No. Look. There.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
No. They asked who I was, then told me what corner.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
I don't know.
About what?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
You too?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
Did you hear what he just said?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
Float me a hundred bucks.
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
How we gonna sleep? We only got a few hours til dinner.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
It means you got a gun?
Coke?
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
How's it going?
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
That's none of your fucking business.
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
I'll take your goddam bet.
You owe me six big ones.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
Read it and keep on reading.
Then the devil is white.
Tell Him that.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
Just hold me.
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
Shhh!
Dear heart, I love you.
So now we have no opening speaker? Why wasn't I informed last night?
I don't think we know for certain.
That's right.
That was a very bad statement. The country loved this man, and you have made it hard in general for Muslims.
Sure, man.
Say what you're saying.
I say a lot of things.
What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
I do know I love you.
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
No. You'll be marked for death.
...That isn't a whore?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
I'm the man.
I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
I'm not... easy.
Give me the address.
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[Who ordered it?]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
I don't understand.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
I feel fine.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
She gave me the evil eye.
Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me.
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Marty.
I'm thirty-four.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
Marty...
Nothing.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
Hey, Ang'...
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
That's right.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
Same general idea.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
Ayuh, only it's early, I need a drink to wake me up.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
He can't take much more time on the table.
The chest-cutter.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Sixteen times.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
We think the same way.
Don't stop now! Please...
...trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against...
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
You betcher ass, General.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
No, no, that one.
When you make up your mind, get in touch. The golf club is probably the best place to leave a message.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
What do we do?
He can move in here with us.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Ayuh.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
I didn't have much choice.
What's the story?
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
Yes, that's what I mean.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Oh, get out of here!
Morning, Radar. How were things?
I out-coached that General Hammond.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Um-hum.
No.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Uh-huh.
No, thank you.
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
You didn't?
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
The Websters.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Well, you're catching on.
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
No.
Where'd you play?
Bush leagues mostly.[5] Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested.
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
Who?
I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
No, I didn't write it, but
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
We don't know how much time we have. If I can get in to talk to him -- maybe we won't lose anyone.
Deal.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Don't give up on her. You're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
I what?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
Yeah.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
To save lives.
That's okay. That's his style.
The jockey!
About six years. My partner took me.
Is it always like this?
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
Let me show you something, Ray.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
This Greg is really getting in my way.
As a matter of fact, I do.
It's very nice.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
About what?
Someone who believes in miracles.
Guests?
Dream?!
Yes.
How long?
What about the customers with reservations?
I'm South Dakota.
He's not plugged-into the system. He's in the fucking system!
It's not used for anything.
The truth.
Why would I do that?
-- You told me.
What are you talking about?
It was a test.
Not you.  A copy.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Scanning body type.
Resurrection.
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
Ah... sure.
Now tell me... what do you see?
... I just pray we're not too late.
NINJA WOLF ZORD!
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
How'd you know?
We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
Strength in numbers!!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Boo-Boo.
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
Why should I be?
What do you mean?
Could we step outside?
An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
Maranzano. Ta ice you.
Ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
That's it.
I can just imagine.
So you all make the same mistakes?
We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
Without us, Masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
I'll handle the Boss.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
What the fuck does that mean?
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
The name's Charlie.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
I don't fuck my partners.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
I turned him down flat.
And what do you want out of this?
Hell. It's been four days!
You wouldn't live out the week.
We can't sell out to those guys. They ain't businessmen!
Now that's a hard number.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Yeah...before your time.
Switch hands.
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
You're acting kind of...odd.
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
Are you okay??
When'd you get in?
What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
You don't like where I live?
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
I can make my own decisions.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
He's an organic farmer.
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
Who?
Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
We're gonna get married.
You know, we're getting married.
Taylor, my dear.
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
For a question!
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
No.
Good as new! It's quite all right--
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Mr. President--
Satan's in this little fella tonight!
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
You're a liar!
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Convene?
No. What had you better--?
You *couldn't*?
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
What?
The Steering Committee.
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
I've been over every foot of it. You couldn't have any idea. You'd have to see for yourself--  --the prairies--the wind leaning on the tall grass--
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Well, if it's all the same to you--
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
Wonderful!
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
That is merely your *impression*, Senator. The Chair has yet to settle the question to its own satisfaction!
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a red-headed doll with a southern lingo, I'll--
What do you mean? What's going on?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
No?
No?
Yeah?  And what else?
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
What do you think?
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
But--if he *does*, Joe--
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
Deeds?
Yes, sir.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Yeah, let's.
That depends on what they see.
What did he play?
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
In a day or so, I think.
I don't blame you.
A girl?
I'm crucifying him.
The guy's balmy.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
Babe ought to get him drunk again.
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
Yes, sir.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
I wanna see that guy!
We'll send for the police!
Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Are those stories true?
Sometimes it's the only solution.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
Well, I play the tuba.
Proceed.
Yes, ma'am.
Where is your farm?
I did what!
The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
Looking for?
Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you.
Uh-huh.
Why's that?
Ernest, what do you think?
I think he's got a point.
I think I've heard of him... a disciple of Rothberg, wasn't he?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
Stop now.
What exactly is it supposed to do?
What do you do?
A little.
Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Could I see Sofie, please?
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
No.
Uh-huh.
All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Which show was that?
You probably got the idea.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
Anything... just ask.
It's called pro bono.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
Really?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
No, no... I have three billion dollars.
Don't you like this?
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
What kind of person do you have to be to do this?
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Just you.
You were messed up, man.
Things got a lot worse.
That'd be Lily.
Psych major?
When?
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
Altar boys?
None of the above, thank you.
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend!
What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
That's one way of putting it.
Intestines.
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
You will not believe it.
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
What did you do to him!?
Two hundred pounds.
Proceed!
What are you doing here?
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
Want to know?
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it.
Who was talking about what?
I'm not?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep --  No offense.
Did you ever see him eat?
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
Come on, Junior, it's a school night.
Let's do it.
Thanks.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Just a waitress.
Me.
I saw him walk you home.
Every night.
It is?
What's your real name?
Me, too.
Yes.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now!  The great ones RIDE ALONE!  Adios, muchachos! 
What have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
But look at him... and look at us.
Who's chicken? 
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Come on.
We're superheroes.
Ow.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
The Disco Boys.
Or Batman --
Shut up.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
The who?
He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
Great timing!
May the forks be with us!
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
Bertrand, sire.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
To Joseph Bonaparte -- Dear Joseph, I have been informed by my wife of the cold and spiteful treatment she has been receiving at the hands of my family, since my departure.  I am also informed that you have refused to pay over to her any of the money I left with you expressly for this purpose.  Must you, too, take this opportunity during my absence to indulge the petty jealousies of the Bonaparte family?
Thank you, sir.
A glass of champagne, please.
No, they're living in Nice now.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
May I suggest that we can prepare and sign the agreement, between ourselves, subject to the approval of the two Emperors.  Believe me, my dear friend, your Archduchess, Marie-Louis, may very well hold, in her hands, the future of our two countries.
I'll have the fire built up.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Good evening, Mademoiselle.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Lisette La Croix.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
My mind is made up.  She will not set foot in my house again.  I think if I saw her again, I might be tempted to strangle her.
Are you trying to insult me?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
Ah, that is good.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
No.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
Yes.
You wrote it.
Do you know what you're saying?
Yes.
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
We have a treaty with Austria.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
Cheeco.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
What's the B-G's?
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
I do.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
Come on.
I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
You damn right that's the big one.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
Shhhh!  Roach, shut the fuck up.
Yeah.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Don't get it twisted, Elroy.  I ain't lost none of my street skills.
What happened here?
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Sorry.
What?
Oh, yeah?
I have a problem.
Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
What?
I will do no such thing.
Then I have time for a drink.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
No way.
How did you see us kiss?
Let' s do it.
To be a hero?
One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it.
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
I see. Where is this gun?
You're a big girl, huh?
I've got something for you.
No, Ben.
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
About what!
About Mr. Powell. All of it!
Mother, I only --
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
Pearl dotes on him.
What?
The money, Icey.
Mister Powell!
Why?
To see Dad?
Why?
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
I mind you said there was two.
Nothin'!
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
Yes?
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
What's your name?
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Naturally.
O' course.
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
John and Pearl!
What?
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept?
The killer.
Meanwhile...?
What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
Put that damned thing down!
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
Go on...
Yeah, nuts.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
No more fights?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
What was it like?
A dress you wear in the evening.
Yes.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Or we can't go back to Russia!
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
No, that's bad management.
You didn't get legal advice?
The Duchess...
Good morning, Gaston.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
No, sir.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Yes.
Certainly.
It's a real Paris reunion.
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
We did our best, Comrade.
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Private.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Confess what?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
No visa.
I must get into that country of yours!
Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
You might hold this for me.
Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
Go ahead.
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
Is that customary?
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Let's forget that we ever met.
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
I didn't follow you.
Why?
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Thursday.
All right, we'll make it red.
Radio! What is radio?
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
All right, I'll listen.
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
What?
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
I must insist that you leave.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
No.
You want me to go to Constantinople?
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch  la Pre Mathieu. 
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Then his office will be fine.
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
Son of a bitch.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
No, we have nothing to hide.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three times that much ...
We are covering up!  For some petty, stupid shit.  There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ...
It's totally out of context.  I was protecting the national security.  I never intended --
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Thou must.
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
What about happiness, Mother?
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
I'd rather get a whipping than have another talk with her.  Anything but a talk with her.
Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be able to afford it now ...
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
We took his system out.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Why?
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
What kind of, uh ... music do you like?
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
Of them.
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
Buddy, before you join the jubilation at my being beaten again, you should remember: People vote not out of love, but fear.  They don't teach that at Sunday School or at the Whittier Community Playhouse!
Not that.  Us.
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
Because ... I have to relax.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Someday, Dick.
To what?
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
No, but I liked your book on nuclear weapons.  We have similar views on the balance of power ...
Well, that's wonderful.  So get me this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be glad to take a look at it.
How's that?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Uh-huh.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Well what would you call him.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
No I ain't.
Yes ma'am, I do.
That's very linear Sheriff.
Wasn't no bullet.
Yessir. Wasn't none.
Yes sir.
Yessir.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
I'll call Loretta when I get there. I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.
I never do.
What do you think.
Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Yes ma'am?
You know what's goin' on?
She'll be all right.
And where is that.
Where does he work?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
No me mate.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
Didn't mean nothin'.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
I could come back then.
Yes I do.
Just call it.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
I'm sorry.
I got beers in my room.
I do like you.
I don't think that's how I would describe him.
The heroin. You don't have it.
So she did witness it?
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
No, I didn't have to.
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
I better go check on them.
I'd rather not...
I gotta go make dinner.
All the time...
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
Yes, she is.
Of course.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
That is a skill!
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Yes.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
I married a car salesman.
...did I win some contest?
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
HE IS REAL!!
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Your husband?!
Like what?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
I'm not telling.
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
Yeah? The sport utility?
Better.
David Ravell.
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Not that I'm aware.
Oh, okay.
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Latch right on to that tit.
Not your...
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
Nobody. It just came to me.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Come over here where I can see you.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
I know.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir!
No, sir!
I said, come here!
What are you tired from?
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
You hope.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
He didn't give you much choice.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
God.
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
Peace out.
There is not one thing funny here.
Yes.
You finish.  Then we finish.
We've got the Kid!  WE'VE GOT YOUR KID!!  What the fuck is she thinking?!
They're not supposed to be here!
Shut up.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
What about us?
Yeah, whatever.
I mean it!
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Don't!
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Ever read any Poe?
No, Edgar Allen.
It doesn't work?!
Shaky?
I don't know, why?
To prove he wasn't chicken.
Shhh...
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
Stop it.
Why?
I'm sorry, Mom.
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
No! This is my private property. According to California law we have a constitutional right to bear arms.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Look this is bull...
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Naw... I gotta...
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
We're like policing the police.
I don't know.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Bullshit...
Where is he?.
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
You got me beat on both accounts.
I know that.
Do you?
First Virginia Regulars under Colonel Hamilton.
With a lace table cloth?
Colonel will do.
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Oh?
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
Yes.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself.
God help us all when you're forty.
Father?
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
No...
Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause.
Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
I know.
No, I don't.
We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort.  It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two.  We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon.  The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.  The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight.  That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks.
Yes.
He left us.
Where is he now?
What are my orders?
Not held, just slowed down.
Thank you.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
For trying to impose some decency on that sort.
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Quiet.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Well, maybe I----
Sure.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Don't worry about that.
Louis--
Shit! Look at this mess!
Come on--let's parole 'em.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Louis, are you sure?
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
Yes, father.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
Not when you can drink instead, at least.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
How did he get off the island?
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
I don't think that will be necessary.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
I'd die for her.
I swear, you look just like him.
On what?
You've seen it?
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
And no lies!
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
That's right.  And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made!
She's lying.  She lost the first one on purpose.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Do you think she loves him?
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
I'm so excited, Icarus.
Not that.
That might work.
Yeah, I do!
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
That's the guy?
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
You know, this and that.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
The big house?
I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
I don't know.
Yeah.  Old times.
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
We've got to get the nanobot.
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
We don't have time to argue, Susan.
It's a miracle.
And you have him?
Dexter.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance
No - give you another guess.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
I'm glad.
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Good morning. What does this mean?
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
Oh, shut up!
Oh, hello Mother!
Look! Look! The front page!
Is that so?
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
With me you can always do business.
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Why not?
Baloney!  Joe! Bring me a special!
My play.
Araby?
Drunk, sir?
Oh no, sir!
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Outside!
You newspaper people have a lot of fun with him, don't you? What is it you call him - the Cinderella Man?
and those and them.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Nothing.
I dyed one and washed the other.
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming?  It will be lonesome without them.  Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
I have. Double-strength!
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
Okay.
Thanks ... I love you.
No, no ... Come on in.
Thanks.
No ...
But you can't go out there.
Lover's Lane!
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
It is?
Oh, no thanks ...
One of those ... big beds?
Thank you very much.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
The basketball team?
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either.
But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote.
I don't know.
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
As a matter of fact he does.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
What do you mean?
Nothing?
That's great.
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
No. She really liked you.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
You know, we didn't call any TV repair.
Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
What?
Look ...
I didn't do anything wrong.
Just gimme the damn remote!
I'm sorry. I can't do that.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
I understand.
Have you cooked the burgers?
Forget about that!
Aren't you a little early?
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
Ok. Thank you.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
I know.
You look nervous.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
I'm just laying on my bed.
It doesn't matter.
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
You're going to work now?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
They don't get opened until eight.
Thank you.
Hi.
Yeah, not really.
Are you guys hurt?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
It's Barry.
Yeah.
Ok. Have a good trip.
Lena?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
I just wanted to make sure.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
Yeah.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
So here we go.
No.
I cut myself.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
......and this is confidential?
And your name?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
You just told me to fuck off. That wasn't good. You're dead.
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
I don't know if there's anything wrong with me because I don't know how other people are.....Sometimes I cry a lot.....for no reason.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
You're goin' on a trip?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
This is a bunch of bullshit.
Nothing.
Seriously.
Ok.
Don't puss out.
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
Yeah.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
He's a writer, not a madman.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
"Turn you out?"
By whom? The Marquis?
Why not?
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
Your words drove Bouchon to --
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
-- that was lust --
Was it impotence?
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
Of course.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
Do you favor its publication?
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
HER NAME, ABBE.
And my own.
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben. Mine is a higher mission.
I'll pay you another visit, with a share of the profits, once its sold.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
There's something else I want from you.
Fiendishly so.
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Mm.
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
And director.
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
The drinking.
Sir, I-
Please be quiet.
And how do you feel when you are lied to?
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
Huh?
No -- no -- I mean--
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money.
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
What?
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
Oh God.
Not one of them today has what you had, Miss Davies. Not one of them.
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
Get out.
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
Well it' s all you've got !
No, we're jake. But listen-
Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but--
I know what you want but it can't be done!
Yes!
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
They wanna talk to you.
All right, you guys, shake hands.
Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
Jack! Enough!
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
Go 'head.
You wasn't with her, were you?
How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
What did Tommy say?
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Where you been?
What?
Whatsa matter with you?
Nine o'clock.
At night?
Jake...
Who asked you?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I went to the movies.
What're you talking about?
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
No, not that.
I dunno.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
Are you drunk?
He should.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
I'll bet it's been done.
I was jaywalking.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
If possible -- both.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Congratulations, Jeff.
Who said I was getting rid of it?
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Next time, have some good news.
Yeah.
That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Police?
You called the police?
You can tell that from here?
No.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Yes.
Not a word.
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
I wish there was one I wanted.
Make the one you want.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Lisa! Shut up!
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
I mean what I said.
Without any future?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
What's the apartment house number?
I don't know.
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
L. B. Jefferies.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
I'm cute, too.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Hi.
Yes.
Shoot, Jimbo.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
He's just loaded, honey.
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Open it.
Come back tomorrow.
I just don't want trouble.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
No.  In the morning.
What?
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
I'm fine.
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Why?
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
I don't know why--!
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
See, I'm new.
You're really flipped--aren't you.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
What a relief!
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
You weren't looking for company, were you?
I'll never get close to anybody.
Hi.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Please, Gabriel, don't...
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Jack. Jack Bangs.
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
We? What "we"...
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
I don't know...
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
Merry Christmas.
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
Where'd she drop her cherry?
Nick don't talk till Nick gets something.
I don't know.
I did.
And I worked there. For a year.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
'Tis the season, convict.
Ash?
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
Cancer-sucker.
Acid-chewer.
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
Oh, man --
Ain't there yet.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Alamo...
GUARD!!!
You're hitting for MY cards!
Now where were we?
Your boss even said there wasn't a set up.
Fine, now.
Was he all pissed off?
Bullshit.
Who, Mr. White?
Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
What? Snap out of it!
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Like hell I am.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
He don't believe in it.
I do.  How do I look?
I said: "Are you gonna bark all day, dog, or are you gonna bite."
Stay put. Okay, fellas, take a look at the little surprise I brought you.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
What do you think?
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
What are you gonna do about him?
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
I'll make the soap myself.
What?
What does a man usually tell a girl?
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
I suppose that's my fault.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
Yeah, it does.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
What's botherin' you, anyway?
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
He certainly could. About a month.
I don't care what he thinks.
Up the trail.
Don't you even know your letters?
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
And you've got me all figured out?
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
Oh, sure.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
I think he wants me.
That's it.
Thanks.
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Sure. We can practice talking.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Actually, I was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
Listen to me I --
She killed herself a week before he died.
But he'll kill her!
It's okay.
It's the sequel.
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Yeah, I broke my fall.
Just wait, you'll see.
Quick, everyone to the lab.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
That turned out to be a good thing! It's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier. Remember that weed? I'm about to get paid.
That's fantastic. Our first phenomenon. This is going to be a great weekend. You guys better get some sleep. Dwight and I will take over from here.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
The keys. She took the keys.
Hi.
Just a little Rogaine.
Second best.
Alright, go to the belt store...
I guess so.
How is she?
Mrs. Sutphin?
Keep the change, you son of a psycho!
I'm so happy I could shit.
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
Look officers! Life doesn't have to be ugly.  See the little birdie? Listen to his call.  Peter Pan! Peter Pan! Peter Pan!
It's Ok, Eugene. I understand... I'll go fix breakfast. 
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
GODDAMN YOU!
It's not fair!!
Socially... I'll have a beer.
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
I do, please.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
But...  I didn't wish... I didn't want him DEAD!
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
Yes... but... I didn't...
There is one big problem though.
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
You could go and open the door.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
Drink.
Thank you.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.
Hello, Frances.
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
Redi's all right.
She's a pretty good sort.
What did she want to know?
The Morgue? No wonder you fainted.  I wish you had come to me first.
But you have treated me that way.
I'd like that.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
Good night.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
What's wrong, Mary?
But you should make her laugh, Jason. Come, make jokes for her. I'll bring your food to their table.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
No other reason  no woman not the little Miss Gibson?
A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
It seems right to us.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
It won't hurt.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
No. Why?
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
You mean like "time flies"?
Sister older or younger?
Who's Elizabeth?
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
You had sex with you therapist?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
What kind of personal project?
All of these are interviews?
Yes.
About sex?
Everything about sex.
Yes, I do.
That's a good question.
About me?
Why not?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
I've told you.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Why not?
Who'd you have lunch with?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Loud.
He does.
Yes.
Yeah, so?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
No, he left last week.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
Not really.
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Will you stop? Jesus.
Fine.
No, I didn't.
No, it's nothing like that.
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
I don't want to talk about it.
Apparently.
Because I wanted to.
Why?
There's a phone here.
It was busy.
So will you, someday.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
What do you get?
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
I'd like to make another tape.
I'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
In here!!
Not today. I've got other plans.
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
Hung up.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
Did he put you up to this?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
Student?
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
So is my wife, asshole!!
Hi. Want a drink?
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
That's the one.
That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!
Did I say anything?
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
I don't get it.
WITH LEGS LIKE MINE I'M REALLY MADE FOR DANCING
BREAKING OUT
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
I got it!  I got it!!!
He needs help.
I've caught it once or twice.
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Yes, Betty.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
What do you mean?
He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
YOUNG BLOOD
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
SIN-I-FUL
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
Highliner.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
I know. I might need to be spanked.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
I'd rather have a knife.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Thanks, Jack. So do I.  Here we are.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
When do we get to drink it?
Yeah, that would be a good move.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Fuck you.
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Right now.
Okay! Jesus!
What the fuck are you doing?
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Can you give me some room here?
Oh yeah. Sure.
Put me down, Jack.
It's private.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Yeah, I know.
What was the bottle that did it?
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
What's the title?
Um... yeah but it's more...
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
I had class.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Ken.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.
I told you I need a drink.
Then buy a bottle and go outside.
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
...I will.
...I will.
I'm here.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
Just make noises then.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
They already know we're here.
They're right behind the door.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
Have they said anything about our area?
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
What was the first thing?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
No.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
What do you mean, the horses?
You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
Have to.
So far that's all I seen in this life.
Where's Jake?
Yeah... that must have been it.
You must have known that before you came.
And they were two of them. Look --
Right... I thought they always did it at dawn.  So long, kid. I'm sorry.
They got a saloon there?
You own this land.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
I don't have any family any more.
Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
Good-bye, Paden.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
It's the only place I'm happy.
Why'd you go into business with him?
You sure? Maybe that's the kind of friend I am.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
There isn't one.
Even the fall from the plane?
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
Thank you.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
Not if I don't let her.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Hello, is this Elaine?
It was a great show, Dad...
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
Of course.
Please put your clothes on
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
It was more in passing.
Body double.
Why not?
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
You want me to call Security?
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
Good for you, Hank.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
What's that?
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
I'm already dead.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
I do okay.  How about you?
You know me -- married to my work.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
Lainey...
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Er,... good.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
But that's Simone's part.
... digitized.
Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
Don't step in the horse manure.
Thanks.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
Congratulations.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Something I want?
No.
Yes.
Why don't you think about it for a while?
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
You do?
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Anything bad about me?
Tell you my secrets.
Got it.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Which street corner?
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
You need someone who can protect you, Suzie.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
Well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Name something.
Mmmm -- so can I...
You never had trouble communicating before.
It's you. You and your father.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
Sorry.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
You took Bill.
We're coming your way, man!
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
I got to leave my post.
Shut up.
When one sees you they all see you.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
Uh-oh.
Yeah?
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
See ya, Kate.
You sure do.
Waynette!
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
No.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  Right, Fred?
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
I'm here.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Where the hell are you?
Who's Fred?
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Oh.
Now, you just find him, son.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
But there were more of you?
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
Like a mafucka.
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
What are we talkin' on the split...
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
Security's locking down the elevators.
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
You'll end up like me.
A puppet.
We're done.  Oh, I should tell you, I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
Not her.  It.
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
That depends.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Not necessarily.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Maybe you can.
I'll go with you.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What kind of look?
I did too.
Rheya.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
I never said I didn't.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
Who are you, then?
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
You must have been dreaming.
Fuck me.  I knew it.
And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it serious?
Looks a little constipated to me.
Occasionally.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Sooner, the better.
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
You asked.
Open the door, will you?
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
Do you dance?
I know.
I know.
... Don't explain.
"For"...?
Claire...
Nothing.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
I might stop you.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
What did you watch?
He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
Mom and I got plans.
Shooting.
Shooting?
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
-- no, I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
See?
Harry!
Don't be pitiful.
Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Well...
He knew.
Even if they're not clever.
What if you get hurt?
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
I-- uh--
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
I'd never admit that.
I think I'd like that.
Strong...
Waldos.
Peter-- my condolences.
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
I will finish what I've begun
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
I left a paper in my desk.
No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
Roger.
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
And maybe a little something else?
You make my mouth water.
Take it.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
My legs are frozen.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
I'm okay here. Why bother?
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
What exactly is he charged with?
Jawohl.
Betty Grable!
You're teasing me again!
You did?
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Why, sure!
Anything else?
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
You off your rocker?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
What did you say?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
One minute to warp core breach.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
But I never had a wife, children, a home like this.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
All of us.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
Yes, yes, it is.
Better?
Close to retirement?
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Aye.
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
Plasma coils...is there any way we can use that to our advantage?
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Incredible machine. Helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
I went wrong.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix.
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
. He will remain always as he is.
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
... The needs of the few...
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Wait!... Wait...
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
Uh -- what are they?
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
I didn't expect anything.
Let them eat static.
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Chekov, who is this man?
Aye, sir.
I'm going down to the station.
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Spock?
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
Yes, SIR.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Yes, we've been through death and life together.
How far?
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
That's it?
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
Battle stations.
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
I would accept that as an axiom.
I just wish we could cloak the stench.
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Dammit, Jim, they've made him into a goddam green-blooded computer!
Not me, Bones... They did it.
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
I liked him better before he died.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
Fundoscopic examination --
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
Shields, aye.
The hell they did.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Or believe, I'll bet.
It's his way.
Hm?
Who do you think I am?
Noon tomorrow...?!
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
What is our target in time?
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
I have.
If memory serves, there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects. By the beginning of the fusion era, these reactors had been replaced, but at this time, we should be able to find some.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
Aye, sir... Three-one-zero to the Bering Sea. E.T.A.: 12 minutes.
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
I am well, Admiral.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
A perfect moment?
I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Your Captain used to cut quite a rug...
Is it safe to move her?
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
A planet in Federation space...
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
May I talk to you alone?
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
... had regenerated.
Even if it doesn't, they'll be teaching kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come.
How long 'til they reach us?
Yes, we do.  You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops.
Aye, sir.
Would you like something to eat?
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
No, sir...
Say the greeting again...
Why was Data assigned?
What are they interested in...?
You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants.
No children?
Whatever makes you comfortable...
Why don't you try sitting up?
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
That'll be interesting.
You think they're still up there?
Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again...
We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
We're crossing the threshold!
Huh.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes.  For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship.
No... I'm from France.
Why?
Worf... torpedo... now!
Unless you'd like to stay.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
Destroy the deflector dish.
Right.
Vulcans sleep lying down...
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
That's the question -
We've been set up all along.
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time to -
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
We were until your torpedoes!
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
I beg your pardon?
You feign ignorance?
That, either as an instrument of Federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative, you and your fellow conspirators crippled KRONOS One and cold-bloodedly assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council. Then you and Doctor McCoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete.
Yes.
Spoken by you?
Well, I -
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Now we go to Starfleet?
Starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres. All vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors...
This cannot be easy for you, Captain...  I would feel awkward if I had to give you a tour of OUR vessel...
They'll be here...
Kill him! He's the one!!
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
It IS possible.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
You hear that?
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer. Starfleet has always -
I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
Not yet... Section 4236...
What do you suggest, Lieutenant? Opening fire won't retrieve the Captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid.
Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
In nineteenth century France, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines, flung their wooden shoes - called SABOTS - into the gears to stop them. Hence the word SABOTAGE.
Visual!
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
At present, he's surrounded by a magnetic shield. If my calculations are correct, he should be deep into his escape planning by this time.
No.
Because you are dangerous.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Yes.
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
And this makes you "sad"?
It would appear so.
It'll only work for one of us.
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... Im a talking head.
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Make it so.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
On screen.
Sir --
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
I intend to.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
I know.
How did you end up on Remus?
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
Were we always explorers?
What's this all about?
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
We are.
Why are you here?
Long ago.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Disruptors are off-line, sir.
But, Praetor, you won't survive without him...
They're holding position.
They will obey, Praetor.
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
We should have. Let me see.
Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it?
No.
Elmo's...
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
What's all this for?
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Flashlight.
Money.
Minneapolis.
Closed.
Shit?
I...
Shit!
You didn't even see it.
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
Yes. Day... night.
No.
Then let me go. You don't need me.
You want this ticket?
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
That was beautiful.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
No. Get in.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
The cook.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
You promised.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
No, thank you.
Where?
In the cars, too?!
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Yes.
Hop in.
No.
You saw that?
Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
Jesus.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
Watch and see.
No, Lenny.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
That's a good one, coming from you.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
No.  Mace is in this.
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
But this is a bad one.
No.  But his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs.  They put an amplifier in-line to boost the signal till it french-fried his brain.
Okay... what about Strickland?
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
Where's Faith?
You know, statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die.  Shit being number one.
You bet.  Did you like it?
I won't say anything.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Commissioner Strickland.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
There's a plus side?
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
No.  It didn't.
You never told me.
Uh unh.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
Just Lenny.
There's more to this whole thing than you think.
Besides that.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
I'm on my way.
Hi there.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
She's buried.
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Who?
Go ahead.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
There was talk of a file photo.
I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
Five months. I love it.
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
You want to have dinner?
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
Does Koessler ask about me?
No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
Oh.
What's that?
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
What did you do to end up here?
I screwed up twice, sir.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
You have to put things in perspective.
What do you drive?
I'd say about two weeks.
Nikki.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East.
I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore...
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Why not?
Well, who represents you back east?
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Me too.
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
Well that sucks.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Classy.
It's unbelievable.
You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
She wasn't your type anyway.
Well, you're doing so well...
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
Make someone bleed.
You asshole.
Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
S'up Trent?
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
What Vegas?
Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Did she, or did she not smile?
It doesn't matter...
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
You think so?
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
We didn't do so bad after all.
Stop.  Ladies, don't you double down on an eleven?
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Michelle went for you, right.
That was different.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
No. Doesn't that suck?
Yeah.
What a surprise.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
Is she looking now?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...Yeah.
...it's on.
Be smart about it.
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
I'm not hungry yet.
Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show.  That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
Can I do something for you still? You're not too rich, or too famous that I can't help you?
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
And this?
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
Yes.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
No, she's going home to her family. She'll join me in a few weeks...
This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
How will they come at you?
Who is he?
What time do they expect us?
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Can I go to the hospital with you?
I don't think so either.  I better go.
Theresa.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
Send some bodyguards.
The kid's right.
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
Probably a year...
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Shut up!
Okay, darling.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
Sure.
This is so good of you.
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
Your parents met her.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
Sure. I love Venice.
You're breaking my ribs!
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
Copy out from here...
Like Clark Kent.  Now Superman.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you...
Ripley's plans.
What?
How?
Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying!
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
Have you done something to your hair?
I think it might hurt her to know.
We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to --
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Where's Dickie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
You've got Dickie's rings.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
Excuse me?
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
Okay then, you're crazy.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 
Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
Not at all. Morning Tom.
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
No key, huh?
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
No.
November 7th is my information.
I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
That's an expensive gun.
My name is Travis.
That's really something.
I know. I could have picked you up.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
Well, I don't follow movies too much...
My God!
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Kidding around... you know, fun.
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
You sure he's not Italian?
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
And what happened?
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Don't you want to go?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Huh?
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
Why not?
What's so important?
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
Got your license?
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
We don't need any misfits around here, son.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Yes, Sir.
I've seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
Take it or leave it.
Hey Wizard.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Yeah?
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
What do you have, a FUCKING WATER PISTOL?  Get him back!
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
Tell me what you really do.
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
Partners.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
You look... different.
Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
What?
I don't smoke?
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
By all means.
A super market.  Huh.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
The film broke...
Zackly.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
Hey, it's the best way to tell.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
I can play the piano?
Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it "heaven music."  "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say.
Cat.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Oh.
What exactly did you hear?
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Don't mention it.  Whoever-you-are.
No.  No, not Miss Sinclair.  I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
All right.  All right.  We'll see.
No. Just a few hours.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes.
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
How'd you happen to come here?
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
I suspected as much.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
What do you mean?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
Mom, they're in a cage!
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
No, it's Lois!
And the white house?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Daniels.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Yes?
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
Whose side are you on?
I'm sorry, Mitch.
Get a rope!
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
You don't have to.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
What good will they do?
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
We know what it is, Al.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
We met in court.
I didn't break that window!
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
I think you're a louse.
What made it...
Yes.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
His wife changed the channel.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
You were lying.
What did it say?
I think it could be fun.
Cheers.
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
No, tell me.
I'll get it.
Really? Tell me about it.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
It was like that yesterday.
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
No, no...
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Maybe.
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
If you don't even know what you want to do...
Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of...
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
Good.
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
I can't believe that.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
Pulse?
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
It was a woman when we put her in.
You will not have it?
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
This is a gift you'll not return.
Give me money or I'll tell the police you murder the "subjects."
But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
She would if she could.
Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
I'll get him.
You're wrong.
Someday he'll surface and I'll get him for both of you. I promise. I'll find the guy with the scar.
I was hoping you'd find out.
Yeah. I sure will.
You're a friend of the guy who killed her, aren't you? You almost sound like him.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
No matter what happens... you're innocent... I promise...
Erin. I'll always be with you.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
You killed my daughter.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
I want you... to bend over.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
Yes -- of course.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Where is that?
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
I was only hoping to make you understand.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
You ready?
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
But I suppose you know the answer.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
Can't stand light?
We blew it, Edgar!  We lost it!
The Prince of Darkness.
You don't have to beat me, Michael.  Just try to keep up.
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
What?
When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch.
I told Max eight o'clock.
Did we have a date tonight?
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
I'll pass.
Okay.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
Mom!
-- a job.
Hi, Thorn.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
Burn??  Are you kidding?  It's freezing!
Star.
Now you and David...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
I know, I've felt it...
Take laddie.
They'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us.
Will you give Mom a break?
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
So what's our problem?
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
No, you're not!  I don't trust any of you!
I don't know who to trust.
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Now hold on, you dumb...
If it did get to him.
Hell no.
Look, I'm just guessing...
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Smart S.O.B.  He put it together piece by piece.
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
Well, get to it.
I'll put this right through your head.
Don't let up, Childs!
The journey is part of my work.
I figured that.  What kind of accident?
How did you know?!
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
We make them see what we wish.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
Sorry... I was distracted.
Hold on... I know I have it...
No... let's walk through the city.
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
For God's Sake, David --
Good night, Alex.
His home.
That machine --
How long ago?
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
Thank you...
And this is your "work"?
I mean, why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
You lost someone.
Mara --
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there, where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but, yes, this is about the kitchen.
Tell him to go away --
May I get you some --
Imagine that.
Might I ask why?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
Kalen...
No, you're safe --
And you've no idea where he went?
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
I'm fine.
Then don't.
You killed him?
How...how are you here?
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
Our car won't start.
Jackie.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
What for?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
No, he didn't.
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
Good. How's your mom?
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
How?
I never knew my father. Did you?
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
Why would we do that?
The future doesn't look different?
You told me this was how it happened.
Good.
Yeah, you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
The Jacket.
Good.
[Beat] Thanks.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
What?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
How are things goin' out there?
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
You want to come on in?
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
I'm a robber.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble.
Maybe.
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I'll see you later.  Be ready.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
Ready when you are.
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma.  Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico.  I'm going.  Are you coming with me?
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Taking a shower.
Litterbug.
It won't work.
What little dogs?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
Sorry!
Yeah, you want it?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that?  Like you've got something to look forward to?
Pass him!
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
It's grand!
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
No, I just meant...
I guess.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Yeah, right.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
Hey, look on the bright side --
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
I am?
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
Huh.
Who?
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals...  ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
No I can't.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
No thanks.
You own a home there?
It's right there on your golf bag.
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
That...? Vestibule.
Have you seen it?
Forget it. It was... fun.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
You're a sick man, you know that?
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else.  My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Fucking sickening.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
I appreciate you looking out for me.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
The prom -- you going?
Just a minute.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Why not?
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
Toy poodle!
Go!
What?! No please, sir --
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
Of course. Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy.
Then you'll call, right?
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey.
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
It shouldn't have. But it did.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
He was.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
I was, you bastard.
There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man.
I don't know. I don't know.
Yeah, a good political solution.
That may be what they want us to think.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Sioux Indian, right?
That's what it looks like, doesn't it? But that's what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
Ray.
Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
Thanks, Cooch.
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
Let the press through.
-- Well, maybe two-seventeen.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
He said he doesn't know.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
You got Jimmy. Let her go.
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Ain't prayer flags, that's for sure.
1868...
Move it, Magdelana.
You forced an innocent man to run like an animal. You've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters I never wrote... you've been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. And now you're here, arresting me at a sacred place.  In your eyes, that's power.
Great.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
Too aggressive?
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
That's true. What are you?
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission.  It bothers you, why? You're part of it.   Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
What?
Why?
What?
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
What kind of games?
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
How does it go?
Take something off.
And that's one!
Well what?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
I live here, remember?
Well?
Yes sir.
Remember one thing.
Sir?
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
No! Now we're inverted!
So, you're scared--so what? You ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I'm goddamn terrified.
Okay, okay.
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Just relax.
On what?
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
He won again.
GET LOST!
Nope.
Just below ten thousand.
But you continued to fight.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
I called your house.
I know.
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Come on...put his head in place.
Oh, I get it; I'm dreaming!  And this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
That's right.
Swallow this.
O.K., everybody pull out!
Oh, Rekall.
Harry!
How was your trip to Mars?
You went to Rekall, remember?
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
I've got Quaid.
Thanks for taking Johnnycab.
Nobody?!  What's her name?
But I'm always home by morning.
Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Let me finish!
And falling in love?
I'm here at Rekall.
What's in the two week package?
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
Whatever you say...Just answer one question.  What is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
I used to model for 'em, why?
Like what?
Oh, since when?
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
Cannon fuse.
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
You got that right.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
A man who plans ahead.
Me, too.
I'm gonna help you.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Civil?  I'm civil.
What?
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
You bet.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah, Val.
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
I didn't do it!  What's going on?
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
And one good guy.
I have to talk to your brother.
Where's the nearest hospital?
So noted.
Do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment.
Oh really?
How can you remember that?
No further questions.
Right, I forgot... We're pledged to protect every mid-level drug dealer in the Tri-state area.  It's an awesome responsibility.
I specialize, Roger...
Chinatown street gang.
-- You found his mugshot?
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
-- Yeah?
You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
That's why I hate experts.
I'm not that desperate.
I followed her from the courthouse.
-- Me? Neither.
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
Right.
EXACTLY!
Racist asshole came at me.
Afraid of what?
What went down?
"No," what?
See-cil. I'm Eddie Dowd, this is Roger Baron. We're lawyers.
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
This and that.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
That's big of you, Bob.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Mr. Stipe. A young man named Jimmy Chin was shot to death eight years ago, in Chinatown. Do you remember talking to the police?
She is preparing a great abundance of food.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Did she have someone with her?
NO, IT'S OREGON, PORTLAND, OREGON. IT'S REGIONAL BUREAU CHIEF COLE. OUT IN PORTLAND OREGON. I NEED YOU OUT HERE, CHET.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
ALBERT, COME BACK HERE. HE'S GONE CALL THE FRONT DESK.
You are here and there is no place to go...
He didn't suffer.
Any friends?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
I see. He does talk loud.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Oh.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon.  James is the one.  He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Dancing.
Laura, I am your friend.
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
We're on our way, Baby.
"Oh, Laura..."
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
What?
See what?
Sex?
They were looking for wood.
I forgot my books at school.
What?
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Fine.
You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
Norma, are you alright?
I'm fine.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
What is the truth?
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
I...
Orthopedics?
Through, through his book.
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
...I made a reservation at...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
No, you did fine.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
I am on the staff of...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
Mrs...
What did she say?
I was held up.
What?
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
I'm a lawyer.
Really. How wonderful for you.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
I've got to work.
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Is there going to be a later...?
I don't have a goddamned idea.
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
This is Miss Costello...?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
No.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
Who are you protecting, then?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file.
Come on. Let's get a drink.
Don't touch anything.
To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead...
What?
You got a good memory, Franky.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
...one of the other nurses?
The Hospital...?
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Yes.
...of the procedures...
We'd be in all the papers!
We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
How can you say that when you don't know him!
Like...ah...
There's only about one explanation for a thing like this..Got a pin?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
I liked him.
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
It was...  ...one of them!
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
Right.
It was nearer than that.
You mean that was a...
I don't follow.
Guess so.
What?  What kind of episode?
Like what?
Absolutely.
You don't understand.  If Dylan falls asleep,then...
Can you come with me in my dreams?
That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
Here.
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
When do you think it'll be done?
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
You really think Dylan's okay?
What are you talking about?
'S okay.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
You miss him.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
North, north-east.  And Dick, please make a note of our final position.
Yes sir.
I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
No, I can't.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
You're not a moron.
Me either.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
It was a bad dream...
I gotta go.
Speak up boy!
I'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
Of a fight he can't win out here.
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
So is violating international law.
Is that what you were trained to do?
I know.
Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
I couldn't do it.
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
Outer.
What?
May I ask you something?
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
How old are you?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
No.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
What is it?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
You still screwing sixteen-year-olds in the ass?
That guy Sailor came around this afternoon... Asked me if there was a contract out on 'im.
No shit?!?! You know him?
Club Zanzibar.
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Muchas gracias.
In many capacities.
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
You ain't actin', mama.
Why, honey?
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
What'd you say to her?
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
We got through two states already.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
It's just another case, Sailor.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
Yeah, I'm here.
What's that?
I'm afraid she is, baby.
Let's get outta here, honey.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
And Bobby too, I hear...
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
Shake hands with your daddy.
Lead the way.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
SAILOR!!!!
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Got any plans?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Wouldn't make any difference.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
Take care of him?
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Through the forehead?
On one condition...
Someone's gonna see us.
No...
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
She's still a transvestite.
Mm.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Tripp.
Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile.
What's to tell?
I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on.
So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too.
A little.
So what are you doing out here?
I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it...
That's really it.
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
Right.
There is, but it's not that interesting.
The guy on the phone.
What'd he say?
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
There is, but it's not that interesting.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Kinship.
Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
What would you call them then?
When nobody's looking.
Near Carvel?
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.
Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Just checking.
Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives?
That strikes me as odd.
I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
No, it's not that, it's...
All right. This morning --
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
Did you confess?
Really? That was fast.
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
I'm in love with your wife.
Only when I'm working.
And?
I might have his number on campus.
No, I'm going ho --
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect.  Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
Huh?
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
What party?
How does it sound?
I have to go.
Why don't you just tell me?
You can't talk to me like --
Like a piece of shit? In my eyes, you are a piece of shit. Think anyone would miss you if I threw you out the window right now? I could say you jumped when I came in. Who are they going to believe? Not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit.
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
Yes.
Woodsman?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
Yes.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
Are you taking your medication?
Yeah.
Can I ask how old you are?
No.
Banished... yeah.
Yes?
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Ev-i-dence.
Will I ever be normal?
How do they know?
I know --
Go home, Walter.
I'm relaxed.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
I want you back in your chair! Right now!
What else?
It was a small house.
What picture?
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
What about them?
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Since you've had sex?
What?
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
They seduce you?
Nothing. It's over.
Being here, with me.
I'm not scared.
I need a shower.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
Okay, good reason.  Then what?
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
Your rig?
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
What happened?
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
Fine.  Be that way.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
Chill out, Lindsey!!
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
We've only got one suit.
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Yeah, for now.  Our first priority's to get something to breathe.
All right.  Do it!
I can't... make it... podner.
Missed what?
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
What's the timer set for?
But how could you say such a thing?
You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
Have you decided?
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Are you joking?
Does it please you to say such things?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Why?
No reason why...
Aren't you going to change?
Tell me once more.
Better dead.
But then why did you bother changing?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
But why all nudes?
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
What do you think?
Me?... I no longer have any interest in building... And, then, where can you find boulders of rock like this in Milan?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
Why don't you try?
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
I don't see why I should mind.
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
Yes, we will.
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
He talked to you Himself?
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
Why?
Agnes...
That's not what he meant.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Why?
Yes Mother.
Was it Sister Marguerite?
What would you like to talk about.
Right now?
Yes.
He's told you?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
And you like that?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Yes.
Where?
The baby they made up.
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
What do you mean?
I can't have them any more.
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Where did you go?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
You have trouble sleeping?
I don't know.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
Agnes...
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Yes.
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
I'm afraid.
I really love you.
Who am I?
Because I'm in trouble.
Of what?
Did you want it to come out?
To be a mother?
Yes.
Hm hmm.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you do?
I don't know which one 
What did she mean?
Yes.
Not your fault...
For what he made me go through.
I hate him.
It was alive wasn't it?
Yes.
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Look into the convent records.
Why?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Who told you this?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
That's ridiculous...
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
Nuns... you hate nuns.
Yes.
Oh, Dear God...
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
I knew that after the fact.
Because I didn't know... 
Oh, God.
I haven't decided yet.
Begin what?
Then let's begin.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
For the Church?
How  ?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Did you know she was pregnant?
The baby?
The scandal...
No!
They are?
I bet you're  -- sixteen!
Just you?
Yeah?
Sixpence.
The police station.
He'll be pulp by now.
But I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
Get him out of here!!
Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
Come here.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Oh aye, but I thought ...
The big hammer?
Oh aye, a sledge.
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
I'm not wrong.
Lip reading.
Don't dramatise.
Yeah ... so what?
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Aye, before anyone stops us.
No.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
What?
Well, you look like him.
I knew I could rely on you.
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn't got any.
I know, that's the trouble.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Get knotted!
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Looks like a derelict.
What is it, I can't --
God I'm hungry.
<u>OH GOD IT HURTS SO BAD</u>!
A voice transmission.
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
What do you mean?
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
It's still in the ship?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
What?
All right -- Roby and Melkonis will go with Faust.  Hunter and I will make up the second team.
Right.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Does anybody know what happened?
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
Should we go outside and bring him in?
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
Hey!  what about the film?
The same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship... except they took one of those jars on board, and opened it there.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
What is it?
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
They're on the next level up.
Tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs.
Engine room, what happened?
I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
Right now let's keep it closed.
What's that supposed to mean?
Can we get to him?
No such luck.  I saw it running down one of the corridors.
Look...
No... don't...
It's nothing, Doc.  Just a... touch of indigestion... something.
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
Yesterday.  We got the Network feed from Gateway; it was the top story on 'Sixty Seconds'.  Biggest market crash since twenty-four.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
What?
That's a fact.
Just got a reading...
It's alright, it's cool...
No, he's stopped; he's totally still. Just take it nice and easy, babe. Nice and easy...
Where does that lead to?
Okay.
One final point.  Killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  However, just to add a little incentive... I'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
Uh-huh.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
Just curious.  There's a lot of talk goes around.
Real man' drink.
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
I... I can't!
You got it, cowboy.
I call myself Phoebe.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
Just like it.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Lloyd and I.
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
I can't believe my ears...
What of it?
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
Yes, Addison.
Take your nap, now. And good luck for tonight.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
Well, I can't yell "Oh, butler," can I? Maybe somebody's name is Butler...
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
We all have abnormality in common. We are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity, we Theater folk. We are the original displaced personalities...
She may be later than you think...
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
This is Eve Harrington.
Everything... everything's so funny...
Where's my coat?
Huh?
That I am...
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
You in a hurry?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
How is Eve? Okay?
Okay.
When I'm guest of honor?
So she seems.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
For instance what?
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
I'm trying terribly hard.
Well, I am.
No thanks, Birdie.
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Hmm?
Now you want an argument.
She's loyal and efficient-
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
You rest. I'll get it...
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
She's got to meet you-
Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
There can't be very much-
- an understudy's performance.
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
That won't be necessary. Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town...  ... it's quite a story. Addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth. I had a time persuading him...  ... you'd better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.  If I play "Cora," Addison will never tell what happened - in or out of print. A simple exchange of favors. And I'm so happy I can do something for you - at long last...  Your friendship with Margo - your deep, close friendship - what would happen to it, do you think, if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her - for my benefit? And you and Lloyd - how long, even in the Theater, before people forgot what happened - and trusted you again?  No... it would be so much easier on everyone concerned, if I were to play "Cora." And so much better theater, too...
There are other plays...
San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
I've got it.
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
Hello, Miss Channing.
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
Ain't it the truth?
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Why should he - and why should you?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Well...
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
It's just possible she didn't...
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
I wonder why.
That's quite a change of subject.
For once, to write something and have it realized completely. For once, not to compromise-
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Nothing...
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
Don't be evasive.
That's beside the point.
I never said it was!
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.
She is a louse.
I mean really, deeply angry...
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
Anything to help you out, Max.
--mine's better--
Hmm.
We need a sympathetic face.
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
Who'd you vote for?
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--we gotta top the Times--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
Only everything...
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--jeeeeeeesus--
Sure. I remember seeing a book about Chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the White House Library and the Library of Congress and--
Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
--"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters."  I'm still waiting for it.
--what?--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Give me your checkbook then.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
Just let me get a match.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Of course--my God, you think something this big just happens? The break-in and the cover up, of course Mitchell knew, but no more than Ehrlichman.
There were more then.
You'll have to find that out, won't you?--
Are you sure?
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
I really want to know.
You call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local Democratic Headquarters--tell me, Harry, why should I be smiling?
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
Badly.  You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
-- Thanks, coach --
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
...okay...
This is no imitation.  Removing the hot dog from the Ultradog yields a better dog.  Behold -- Ultradog, no dog.
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
What's your middle name?
I'm glad you think so.
How did you know I was here?
What?
You want onions?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
...yeah.
Yeah right.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
Yeah, enormous.
I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Do you know about the clitoris?
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
What was your name again?
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
You've got something going?
Oh no.
Oh yes.  Very arousing women.  They arouse me very much.  But not as arousing as you.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
Dude, prom sucks.
He didn't?
I think we're falling in love.
Bullshit.  From where?
Would you shut up?
AHHHHHHH!
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
A la votre.
Andy! No!
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
Where?
Well, they are French.
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Allo?
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Now!
Okay. So maybe you were right.
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
Who are you?!
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
Why?
The dessert fork!
It's not you - it's the dress!
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
What do you mean?
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
All the good meetings are taken.
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
Lyndon Johnson?
Tsch.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Huh?
And I love what you're wearin'.
I'll see yuh.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Why not?
Oh, I see, I see.
I know.
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
You are extremely sexy.
Of course.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
M'hm.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
Oh.
No.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Oh. What?
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
What?
W-w-whatta you mean?
Okay, okay. Okay.
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
Are you?
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Oh, when'd you quit smoking?
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
We can show her the schoolyard.
Look, uh...
M'hm.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
She was stealing.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
I don't know. I don't know.
Why didn't you come in?
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids.
Oh my God, the sitter.
I love her too, Joe.
He's not going tonight.
Fuck you.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
Please?
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
When does he graduate high school?
Oh, very jealous.
Harry called.
Lucy overdosed.
But she's alright.
She's in ICU.
And you know our friends, how?
Let me heal you, baby.
Anytime, sport.
So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
We've only been over this how many times?
Well, you're a tower of support.
Through the sweats or not?
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
Don't do this!
I'll be with you.
He's my favorite.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
You're an interior decorator, right?
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
And Ryan works at home.
And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
I'm a little in the puke zone.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
I like you.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Sorry?
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Oh, I love that.  I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are.
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
Let's just go home, okay?
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you lovesick?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
About five thousand dollars.  With my discount.
You don't need to thank me.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
And here they are!
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
Ah.
And the food sucks, I know.
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Wanna dance?
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Really?
You're right!
I order you to find out where we are!
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
Well...no, but --
Yes?
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
You held onto this all that time?
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
I...I have no idea, sir.
Not that one.  Or that one.
...Not enough food?
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
I can't think of any.
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
Why?
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Oh, I understand.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Of course not.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
I'll fix you some coffee.
I mean -- her apartment.
Something wrong with your legs?
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
Fine.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
Seven --  -- queen.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Gas?
Yes, sir.
That's very flattering.
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
You know how people talk.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
You're going to take her off my hands?
Yes, sir.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
No!
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
I have a vague idea.
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
Slow down, kid.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident.  But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block.  Mind if I cool this off?
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
What about him?
Family?
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
No kidding.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
What for? You haven't done anything -- it's him -- what a salesman -- always the last booth in the Chinese restaurant -- and the same pitch about divorcing his wife -- and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face.
Let me take that.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
Remember what we talked about?
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
What do you think?
You know I do.
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran. 
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
I told you -- with my mother.
Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
What's it matter? Get to the point.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
One for all -- all for one --
What is this?
Sometimes.
How long were you up there ?
Whatdoya think it thinks.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
Shot himself. What for ?
Listen.
Maybe.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
What is it?
This gentleman or myself ?
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Well, he's killing now.
Captain?
Yeah -- yeah, I can understand how you feel.
How big it is?
Wh -- what?
You'll find enough Cong up there.
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
You know what you're doing? You are interfering with my plans !
We'll exterminate the fuckers !
I'm taking you back.
He was a remarkable man. It was impossible not to --
Were you with him, when...
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
What?
Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.
Then let's get the hell out of here.
The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer.
When?
Why did they attack us?
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
And shut up.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Well , who's in command here?
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
89   CONTINUED:
150  CONTINUED:
I'll get you there all right.
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
Your infrared camera?
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
Back against the bars.  Now.
Can't be.  Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.
Somewhere along the pipeline.
Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
Do I want to be with you permanently?  Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live?  That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
I don't plan on dying.
I'm right behind you.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
You know Meyerling?
There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Just passing through.
No, I better stay at my post.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
-- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
-- We appreciate the company. Anne Marie's getting cabin fever already.
Dixie's waiting at the infirmary. She'll put a splint on that injured leg.
Hang on...  Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road?  Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
I love you.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Oh, please...
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
My son is sick, okay?
Note. Put it in the note.
Just how grateful I am.
Yes.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
You take off when you have to.
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
How you doing?
The two might go together.
Were you asleep?
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
No!!!
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
You think you're kidding.
No. No. Get Carol.
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Ask him.
How're you doing?
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Melvin...
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
You consider your life easy.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
Right.
So you're from around here?
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
Probably.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
Bullshit.
What?  What's okay?
I know you're going to jump.
Oh, yeah.
A new player.  He's using the name Nicholai.
The fucking contract!  How in the fuck did he know.
It cost us.
Um, five.
Yeah.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
It's not the same, is it?
Better than playing with yourself.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
The C.I.A.?
You went from high school to the Agency?
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
Because I want to know.
That sounds nice.
Okay.  Then what?
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Except --
What?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
I don't believe that.
What did he say?
Ten years later, here you are again.
What?
No?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
And you were drilling these holes...?
Did he explain how this happened?
What?
Attraction is a complication?
Honestly?
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Why?
Last night --
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
Yes.  Please come in.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Can you tell me about it?
Do you believe that?
Yes.
Why not?
I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints!
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
Well, don't get carried away.
Yeah, I'll take some.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
No, but I ran into Jahn, seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the University, they might even be expelled.
Damn!
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
I could try and get a Western lawyer.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
We should be done by the weekend.
What?
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
So, we won't be going to London?
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
But we could go to London and live in England.
Yep, it's all yours.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
Will this thing take long?
How do I know what's being said?
What's the Bugler?
Are you sure I shouldn't get a doctor.
Why don't we both forget about him?
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
Fuck you!
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
What for?
You are quite sure it's secure?
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
Were you with Jamie?
I could take after Dad, too.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
Me.
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Because that's where the fire is?
In ten words or less?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Not possible.
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
He wants help with his lines --
I'm supposed to always be alone?
No.
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
No. I want what's best for you.
That won't be possible.
Yes. You?
You don't. That's the point.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
A similar triangle?
What do you want, Biff?
Gimme some chili, fries, and a Tab.
Third time they've been out there this week.
Fine.
Oh yeah.
Oh -- I'm all right. Say, listen, about this dance Saturday night --
Learn anything?
And where am I gonna be?
In the parking lot, with her.
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
Unfortunately, the way things are going, you may get your wish. You may see the entire annhiliation of the world. If not, you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources. We can already see the air we breathe, not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes. We'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted, in fact, all of our energy sources. Yes, you people have a lot to look forward to -- a lot to see.
Five cents, please.
Shhhhhhhh!
AM or PM?
Then where the hell is he?
Why?
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
Blast it -- no, I suppose you're right.... You do know the proper chemical formula?
Professor, be serious, would you?
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
According to your girlfriend, Suzy Parker, you and she were at the movies. You went to the restroom and you never came out. Obviously, you stepped through an inter-dimensional time warp, created by the original operation of the time machine.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
You lost that one?
You like people?
Sure thing. Come on.
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
He'll say that?
Is that all there is to it?
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
I don't know.
I'm serious.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
What?
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Hold it right there.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
Let her out?  She's a killer.
The door's locked.
What? How do you know that?
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
This is so embarrassing...
You.  Like the papers all say.
Pretty terrible shot.
Another 'you'?
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
What's happening with my call to SAC?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Pictures don't lie.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary  Bill and I are... I love. We-
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
I...
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
And what would that be, son?
I need help, Audrey.
Ever act?
...Huh? No, I'm 
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going  don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
I'd say you're already enjoying some.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
See you, Charlie.
Yeah...
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact  New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
What a dump...
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
Hold on 
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
What do you think happened?
I believe you  I KNOW you. But why should the police?
Yeah, but Charlie 
...Both maybe?
I apologize, Barton.
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 
Congratulations.
Must be.
Home. Watching TV.
Yeah.
No.
Who?
Sometimes I really hate you.
Yes you do.  Something's on with you.  You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
Did you leave the club with him?
Yes, you do.
I have nothing to hide.
Thanks.
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
No.
It's not the same thing, is it?
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
We fuck like minks.  We forget the rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
.38 revolver.  Never recovered.
Somethin', though.
I feel fine!
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
Is he dead?
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
No.
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
It's yours.
Can you check again?
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
It's in New York.
Yeah, I met her already.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
Well, have you asked her to come back?
I don't like beer.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
No.
That's the same guy who did this painting.
Bring him over sometime. I have some other stuff to show him.
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
What?
Not black.
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
 In this corner?
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
For real?
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
You're back.
Hi.
Me? Why?
You like your dad's paintings?
Haitian. I'm going to kill myself. I'm taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.
My point exactly.
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
I just don't think you're being fair.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
And the truth frightened her?
Sure.
What're you doing three dates from now?
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
I don't.  So, no.
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
Coming on line now, sir.
Oxbridge Academy?
Hey, what's your problem?
Freeze, you're mad.  This capsule will slaughter thousands.
He'll be here.
Definitely.
No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
From the other side of the equator-
Dr. Pamela Isley.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
Can I get some help over here?
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
I wish I knew.
Well...um...her.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
You must show me your secrets, blossom, before I show you mine.
Actually, he took the car.
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
...A bat.
I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
What is it about the wrong kind of man? In grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather jackets.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Exactly!
Just ones this beautiful.
You understand obsession better than you let on.
What? This isn't normal?
And now....
They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Rage. Anger. Passion. Pain.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
I figure telling that cop I'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. So no offense but thanks. See ya.
What I do isn't about revenge.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Yesssssss. I know!
I got family. ...Please.
Let's see if you bleed green.
You sunk my battleship.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
I won't let you have it.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
It's gone.
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
Tom Jones?
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
No, I'm fine.
Excuse me.
Ah. Fine.  It's good.  It's great.
Yes, isn't he.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
A car sounds sensible.
Welsh.
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.  No-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
Great, good.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Well, there is that ...
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Okay.....
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
Nope.
Are you?
What?
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Thrr...
Cut the power!
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
What?
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
Who did the sushi?
We were trying to scare your mother.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
Life is just... too awful.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
I think she's in with them.
Stepmother.
I'm lonely.
Well I just wanted to tell you what I saw.
Delia will cook...
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!  It doesn't matter what brand.
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
I thought I saw something.
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
Attic space.
Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.
What happened to the people who used to live here?
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Hardly any, Robert.
Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
Oh. I have a message for him.
Would you care to take it, sir?
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Yes, so do we.
Thank you, Eve.
Hello, Dennis.
Yes. I like to watch.
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
Oh, good.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
Yes. That is correct.
Yes, Ben - he is.
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
Yes.
Sure you do! No one reads!... Listen, book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days...
Oh. Thank you.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
... Good evening, Louise.
I see.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
Yes. It is.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
I see...
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
No.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
Mr. Chance, the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Yes, I will.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Do you need a secretary?
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
It's not that, I just...
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
That could be possible...
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Thank you, Colonel.
Let us toast to the success of the coup.
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Okay.
John Makel...
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
May 11th.
Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. Were supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
I was worried.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
Shut up!
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
You came up here looking for the portal?
I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
I wouldn't know.
You married?
My tits?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
You wanted to be partners with me?
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
You're evil, Maxine.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Can I be anyone I want?
Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
No.
Maxine...
I have to see you.
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
You on your way home?
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Could be that fall you took.
That was fun.
Ella.
I run him off.
He knew Baby Suggs?
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
For what?
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
It ain't what you think.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed?  I saw Denver. She tell you?
She was my best thing.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk to the deadbeat Lebowski.
Yeah, it sucks.
ANTI-SEMITE!
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Thank you, Donny.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
It's already posted.
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
I'm not really, uh.
Uh-huh.
I'm unemployed.
Separate incidents?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Which one was Logjammin'?
On you, maybe.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Oh, no.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Yeah, but what about--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Uh-huh.
But he's--
Exactly.  What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?
Hey man--
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
This whole fucking thing--I  could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.
No, I'm--
Yeah.
No.
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
Huh?
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
Yeah, and you were--
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
No Dude.
Then what's...
It's a heart attack.
Wha.
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
Right, Dude.
Dude.
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
I came all the way down here same as you did.  Keep from gettin' killed. Happened to see those jarheads beatin' on a good collar--  Habla Ingles, Tomas?
We're going to be working as a unit, you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot, Reinhardt.
I'll heal.
Really?  What are we supposed to do, then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
I wouldn't read too much into it.
Why?
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
I don't understand.
I don't like it.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
I don't know about this, man --
Human?
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
Thiavolos, as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire, but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
Not that I'm in contact with.
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
After last night?  Dude, I'm a lover, not a fighter.
It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
How can you be out here?
You're blind --
But, he could've --
You get used to the darkness.
For your miracle cure?
I was afraid that might happen.
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
What?
He looks different now, burns are less extreme, some of these wounds have closed up --
He is an abomination!
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
Trying to find the energy.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
What?
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
Your body, your call.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
Then I'm going--
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
I know, I know.
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
The, uh, blur there.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
What? That made her lose the baby?
What?
No fucking.
What're you, nuts?
--coming out of the water--
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
Hey, hon'--this is what pays the rent and tuition.
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
Goes right along with these two.
The wheel.
Ah, Domini?
What'd you say?
That's the <u>reason</u>.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
Whatever.
--a <u>lot</u>.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
No, I--
Sort of...
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Thanks.
...You ever get tired?
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
You're bad.
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
Isn't that what you want?
I don't follow baseball.
...Friday?
Lubbock?
...Figured I'd better leave before I used it on him. I don't know how you can stand him.
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
What do you think?
You're an idiot.
Don't throw that out.
Right.
What's that?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
You did? A human ear?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Is Sandy part of this?
No. not at all.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Oh he forced you, huh?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
No.
Yes.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Yeah. hurry up though.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
Sure I do.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
No. it's not Don.
No.  Hi baby.
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Go where?
A ride?. Hell, that's a good idea. okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Here's to Ben.
Do you see, Ben?. I can make him do anything I fuckin' please.
Okay Frank.
What do you know about the ear?. anything?
Where are they?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
What am I going to do?
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
Do you want the car?
Nothing. I'm fine.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
Derek!
What is?
Yeah.  I am.
Are you kidding?
We'll take it.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they were kind of cute.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
You're a fucking amateur!
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Murder.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
I need you to go to Miami.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Just sell it, Derek.
Touche.
Just a friend.
Then relax.  It's a federal bank. Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor Noriega has very lenient banking principles.  No questions.  No problems. All the pesados keep their money here. Even El Padrino.  What do you worry? Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who is going to fuck with us?
You're a lucky man, Diego.
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
This is not the time, Diego.
In how long?  A week?
Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and start an i.v. stat!  This man is having a heart attack.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about that ring.  It's something else.  Let me tell you.
It would be my pleasure.
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
Money.
I know.
Dad.
That's where you belong...
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Figured what out?
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
She did that before.
Alright.
Where are you going?
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
Dad.
You mean, like a trip?
There's schools in California.
After everything.  After everything, the only thing left out of my whole life is you.
Do you see him here in the courtroom?
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Yes, I am.
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Don't be such a pussy.
No. It has failed in its objective.
What "group"?
My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
It's a question of habit ...
I think it'll be a success ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
Good evening, sir.
I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
What'd he die of?
Yes.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
What did they argue about?
Could you be more specific?
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
You may call your next witness.
Then she's not as smart as I thought she was.  You've seen her in the depositions.  Tell me you don't have any doubts?
Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
A little after eleven.
What about Miss Lawson?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
It didn't.
Can you give the court an example?
What did she say?
We had dinner at a restaurant.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
That's all Dr. Paley.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
We dated for about a month last year.
Yes -- he did.
No.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
No.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
You didn't know about it before that?
You still haven't answered my question.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
No -- you're not.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
Because I'm expecting a call.
-- But it's Sunday.
Mr. Roston?
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
Please -- not now.
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
What?
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
No. We're going to lock this up and --
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Carolyn!
No, what?
I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
Yeah.
No.
Oh. When did you move back?
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
Do you miss it?
No.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
I told you, I love other people.
No. But I love them just the same.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
How about if I set the table?
Sure.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
What?
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
Nah.
I don't remember!
Died there?  How?
How the hell should I know?
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
What?
Hush, baby.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
I manage them.
That place is already bad luck.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
The dead get out?
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Let me see it.
From what?
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Don't call me that.
What building?
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Now you.
But --
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
What we have to do is call the police.
Open the case!
What are you talking about?
I think you're fucking crazy!
All part of the business.
Violet, please!
No.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
They were in a car accident.
Yes, I understand.
You know he would have done you, too.
Okay, sure, Mick.
This is the police, ma'am.
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying kind.
Not exactly.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
Is that what her daddy tells her?
He was in love with you, right?
I am, but ...
Johnnie?
That's his brother.
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Trust me, Violet.
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
How'd it go?
...  Me neither.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
You're asking me a direct question?
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Treadstone?
...it's a problem...
I don't know.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
So now you know.
Sir, you waited on line.

-- sir? --
-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
One moment, sir.
Yes.  Is he there?
Oh, Jesus... 
For twenty thousand dollars.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
I won't hurt you.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it, I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
That's what I'm saying.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
-- you could put it together --
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
That's it?  Is that it?
Jason...
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- just --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
-- forget it --
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
Wait a minute --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
I told you.  You need to rest.
Thank you.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
It's reply paid.
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
Beginner's luck.
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
What?
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
Shut up!
Information Adjustments.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
Well, terrorists of course.
Stop it ... damn you!
Yes.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
Information Retrieval.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
Really.
Yes.  NO! You can't! You've only just turned it down! 
I did it for you.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
We're meeting Mrs Terrain.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Not now ... please
I know, I know ...!
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Thank you, Dawson.
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Emergency procedures.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
I can't hold up my head anymore.
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
No, no medicine!
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
No.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
He's better.
Five years.
I think I'd remember that.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
Make a left here. I want to stop.
Thanks.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I quit! I'm through!
You can't leave me now.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
The family know?
Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets.
I never felt better in my life.
I don't think the fire people can touch him out there.
Let's get in a fight, then.
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
Used to be my partner.
Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there?  Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Oh, stop it.
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Why?  What did they do to you?
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
Why do you say that?
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Good.
Did you bring your grey suit?
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
I hope so...  No.  I'm not really mad.  I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war.  But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
Upper management thinks you're dull.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God.  They want to fire me.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
The cost-efficient reporter.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
That's okay.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
As long as that's your only problem you're...
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
I was a lot earlier.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Excited.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Uh-huh.
Who?
No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
Uh-huh.
That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
You fucking...
You want to come?
A picnic?
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
I didn't have the guts to ask when I first came up.  I'll get you a great tour.
The way you were looking at me, I just went.
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Better!
I'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues...
I know.  But I wanted to talk to you.
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
What?
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
Right.  Ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
Huh?
Got carried away, huh?
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
What, Mr. De Santis?
You didn't mean to what?
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
Yeah I did.
Haven't you ever heard of smack! Horse!  Junk!  Heroin!
Oh, yeah.  It can get real expensive.
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
I thought you didn't respect money!
Oh, OK.
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
If you see him.
OK Mrs. Swicker.
I was just straightening up the place.
I had him in my grasp.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Litter, yeah!
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Amazing!
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
What's playing there?
Come on, what was it?
You guys are thrashed.
Hi there.
Water.  Okay.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Yeah?
Why'd you come back?
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Pretty shallow of you.
Get away from me!
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
Oh my God you're having an affair.
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
It's true.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Sporting events, yeah.
They were vampires?
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Not if you're careful.
As for example, what?
Football is my life.
They don't even have Dolby.
I was just scared is all.
You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Why?  Why me?
Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
Okay.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Okay.
Right!
Right.
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there.
A little better.
Gimme the God damn ball!
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
Yes I do...
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
it's okay..
Yep.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
Who?
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
Never heard of 'em.
If you believe in Voodoo.
I didn't spit on you!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
I thought I was--
Naw...
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
Yeah, thanks for everything.
Love to--
No.
Check it out.
Ain't here.
Your breaking ball's getting better but ya need a change up.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
Good to see ya.  William would you...
That's right.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
I can't do that.
The worst was Blue.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Yeah.
Wait, hold on a second.
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
702 472 1862.
Well...
Wh-wh -
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.
Yeah.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
No, of course not.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
What?
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
All right.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
Well, it's okay. I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.
What're you doin'? He's a square guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat him like that. He's gonna run to the FBI.
Just say so.
Fine.
Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, go after everything and everybody.
And at the...
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
...you? Do you remember what I told you?
Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' minute here. One minute. I asked you?! When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?! Get this through your head, you -
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
Sammy.
I'll be right there.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
...and she doesn't always -
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
Oh, no.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Yeah.
You sure?
So, I put two million in cash in a Los Angeles bank under the name of Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw. People loved to be around her.
Why do you need that much?
What are you talkin' a- ?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
Listen...
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
I gotta tell ya...
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
Pretty serious.
Okay, no big deal. That's okay. Yeah. He got his twenty-five.  That I'll live with. Any more I couldn't.
Okay?
He wanted a watch, too.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
You threw it away?
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
With Jennifer.
I had a... salad.
What did Jennifer have?
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
Listen to me.
Fuck you.
You understand? What? Let you go?
I am not!
I'm not -
Oh, you are...
...and hypocrisy.
Bullshit! Bullshit!
That's amazing.
These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off.
All right, I will, I will.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
Green?
Shut your mouth!
Well, I've been busy. 
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Hey.
He won't...
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
Hey!
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
Yeah. Fuck him.
Great!
He's not here?
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
Stay out of the way!
For what?
How are you?
I'll take care of it, Remo.
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
I know.
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.
Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' a lot of money for us. And he's gonna continue makin' a lot of money for us, so keep a good eye on him.
Hi, how are you?
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
I can see that. Sure.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
You did. You're right.
Sure did.
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Get lost?
Okay?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
You know why, right?
Yeah.
Get up.
Go fuck yourself.
No, no, no, no!
Fuck you!
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
Since when do you talk like that?
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
I know it, I know it.
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect?  I just love risking electrocution every time I..
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
Now he'll be up all night...
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy, my comrade-- women aren't buddies, women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
You can't get away with..
What's the good news?
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more.
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
This is one way.
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
Then whose is it?
You never miss a trick.
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
Allow me.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
I don't want to know --
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
Shit!
He's right?  Look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
That makes two of us.
I can hear you again, clearly.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
It won't be him.
Your husband?
I can't do it.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
Include me in that.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
Shit.  You couldn't be in much worse shape.
He wants 75 back.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
Dial him up.  We need him to run interference.
Think you could do a picture of me?
What's your point?
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
You'll see her.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
And not a nickel.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Did he?
You fucking did.
Who the fuck is he?
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Scottish?
Like treacle.
Don't know. Who is she?
Jimmy?
You on the game?
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
Depends what it is.
Must be.
You think that's wise?
So they do know.
So I got it wrong, then.
No! I'm going home...
You mean that?
Your soldier.
No.
Then say it.
Not if you go.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
Fergus.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
All right, then. I like to be wise.
Suits you.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
Of course. I forgot.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
You know what. Go.
And what if you don't?
Some judge...
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
You sure about that?
He's at home.
I know that.
Yeah. And the brown eyes.
Kill me.
What do you know about my nature?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
She your wife?
Don't I know it.
You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
Why did you sign up?
And you play cricket?.
I'll bear that in mind.
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.
Why?
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
Yes.
You liked her?
What you say, faster?
Got to catch me first --
Hurling --
You never know.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
He's a good soldier, Jude.
You're crazy --
 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
Let's look anyway.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
No!
Reggie -- listen to me --
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
But no one actually saw him die.
Around one.
What's your first name today?
No.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
It's all right with us --
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Would you like to see my passport?
Sure.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Which one are you?
Okay.
You did.
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Who?
No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
Yes, I know.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
No --
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come.
The money is unimportant.
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
But his mother --
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
What should we give him?
Voil what?
Up there! I would put it up there!
We won! We won!
Quitter.
How's that?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
Is your husband with you?
Do you know what you're going to do?
Having a nervous breakdown.
Be careful, Peter.
What are you talking about?
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Didn't Charles have any friends?
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
I wonder why it's so important to know if they fucked?
Not my imports.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
This will relax her.
She's underage.
I can.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
Why?
What are you doing here?
You gave me a 'D'.
I was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
Twenty eight years ago.
You heard about that?
I'm fine.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Yes?
I need to ask you something.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
Why not?
Who was the fourth?
His mother's side.
What?
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.
Freezer in the back.
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
...ya?
No.
You are not takin' my truck!
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
...-ed.
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
 Shut up.
Okay, okay! 

Okay.
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...man!
Oh, shit.
...do we?
 Okay.
Oh, shit.
Come on!
Left, left, left!
All right, you got it, you got it!
Whoo!

No.  Shit.
 Aw, shit  
...to him!  You don't know who...
Taking it down the hill.


Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
We got two paddles.
We're gonna die!
Oh.
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.

  I've got the real thing!
We've got Elvis!
Tunnel.
Whoo!
What the--?
 What's it say? 
It's melting, man.

Can we get out on your end of the tunnel?

Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!
Who put the big hurt on...
I'll handle this from here, sweet   Owes us a little restitution.
 Yeah.
Thank you very much.
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.

 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Oh, my God.
...such is the price...of patriotism.
We've got it...

...-tor Long.
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
Let's proceed.
No!

Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
 But...
...screwup?
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.

To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.

Thanks.
Very.
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
When was the last time?
What about her?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
Just find the girl.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
With her mother.
Oh, my, yes.
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
Oh they don't?
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
I'll just tell my wife.
Why?
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
I'd like to talk to him.
No. It was an accident.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
I don't.
I want the rest of the pictures.
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
Too late for what?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Gittes, stay outta this.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
Of course.
Obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
Yes.
A private investigator?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Why?
You mean you don't know where you were?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes.  It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
Another satisfied client's wife.
The Valley?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
Easy, it's an innocent question.
And I want to know where.
It has to do with my father.
Give me an example.
Including the death of your husband?
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
I am not!
Then let's go talk to her.
What does it look like?
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
Who is she? And don't give me that crap about it being your sister. You don't have a sister.
Back to Mexico.
Okay...
Sure, but I'd like to handle it.
It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
Who?
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
I never was.
Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.
Water and Power?
Since lunch.
Yes. No.
They were partners.
All she needed for that was the phone book!
Why'd she run away?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
What's she like? What's she like?...
No, nobody came. 
Hi. Why are you running?
Bye-bye, Elena.  ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
For what?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
What does it say there?
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
Huh?  Oh, I forgot - you've been away so long I forgot about your joking -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.

How do you do, Mr. Leland?
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
Of course.
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
There aren't any personal lives for people like us.  He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
I know...  But you do look so silly.
I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
No.  That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
Oh, me -
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Susan, I really think -
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
You can't stop me.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
Not my wife - not either of them.
A wasted day.
Yes?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
Charlie!
What?
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about.
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state.  Well, Mr. Bernstein?
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Rawlston is my boss.
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
The banks are out of luck, eh?
If you'd just let me talk to you for a little while, Miss Alexander. All I want to ask you...
What do you mean?
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
You're shittin' me.
It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this.
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
He went home to change for the big date.
Can I use the bathroom?
Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
I can't believe you're here.
You saw it?
You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.
So you're really getting married?
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
What?
There's more, isn't there?
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You have a better suggestion?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
He's not invited.
I left like an hour ago.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
What smells like shoe polish?
Allan Harris.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
It would stand to reason, yes.
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
Veronica!
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
Because you buckled.
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Yeah, right.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
You've had sex with a dead person.
What!?
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
Yeah, but at what a price.
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
I want to rent a movie.
May I be blunt with you?
I like to expand my horizons.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
This life.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
What responsibility?
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Leave me alone.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
No, she's getting married.
Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
I'm not dealing.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
He died in the bathroom.
You used to go out with her?
Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead.
Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Ooh! Can we?!
Really?
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
And I actually date you?
You were making a generalization about "broads!"
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Who?
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Jesus, would you stop? You make my head hurt when you talk about this.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
What do you mean?
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
He gets off on it.
You sucked his dick!
We went out a few times. We didn't have sex, but we fooled around.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Goodbye, Dante.
I don't want Caitlin...
It stings a little.
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
I didn't do that!
Scumbag. What are you doing?
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
Does he sing in English or Russian?
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
Because he's out of shape.
Shit!  Don't take this the wrong way, but I used to fuck her.
That's sick, Dante.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
I... I don't know what to say.
Twenty bucks.
I will. Take it easy.
Next time you're like watching MTV, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  I mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
I admit, I can be bought.
Rooster!  Forget the hen stuff. Be safe, honey.  Over.
What usually eats a banana?
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
Hi, Gabe.
We spent a night there one night...
I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  You held on as long as you could.  Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb?
I don't expect you to understand.
I don't understand?
Why are you yelling?
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
He can handle it.
That's no good. It'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. If they show, they'll take you too.  Why'd you have to come up here?!
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Take the rope.
Wrap it around that rock twice.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
It looks like a winding route.
Acknowledge.  Winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, Are you near any natural shelter? Over.
Bob and Rick are in Denver.  I gotta get up there as fast as possible.  Frank, get me a load of flares.
We can't and he knows it.
What about it?
Then go fetch.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
No names, this is an open line!
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
Impossible... I don't believe it.
Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
I beg your pardon?
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
What crime did you commit.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
Helping you, sir?
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
Brown hair, is it?
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
I haven't seen you before.
Just part of hospital routine.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me. Alex breaks away again.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
Amen. They cross themselves.
Prison custody?
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
Big, big money.
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased to see you again. All cured too, eh?
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
In my office?
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
I think...
The fat man on Cherry Street.  The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer.  The trumpet player.  That leaves two.
Twenty five?
By the way.  Daniel said he was sorry.
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Vincent...
You're gonna cheer up.
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
It's just a dead guy.  On three, ready?  Uno.  Dos.  Three.
It's not me, it's the engine!  A fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
How about the thingy next to it?
Tonight it is.
Believe it.
Why?
So what?
Yeah.
I listen to classical.
What you mean, no?
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Maybe so.  Maybe she hears what you tell her.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
Dmitri?
Who?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
...indifferent.
Slow down.
I should have done that.  Fixed it and more.  Get out from under what I been under...
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
For what?
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
I have no idea.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Who?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Shoot.
Not this again.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
This way.
Connecticut.
Did you kill him?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
Without a love of my own.
What about you?
Don't do this.
Top pocket...  Go on.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
That's great.  Good for you.
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Whatever.
And you feel bad for it?
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
A dog.
So you'll believe what I tell you next.  Because I need to find Jerry.  And I don't think I can do that without you.
I don't understand.
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
All the elements are there.  A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress.  The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
Meaning...
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
Do you have a minute -- ?
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
What?
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
Thank you?
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
Nice.  Where?
It's beautiful.
Could we hear God?
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
So we passed some kind of test?
The librarian... or the library...?
So.  What happens now?
No!  I mean... why so soon?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
A page-break signal.  A period.
Greenbank?
But what about your research -- ?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
Something like that.
Really.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
It's getting late...
It's late.  We should go back.
What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy.  A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social.  The weak.  The sick.  The unwanted.  And ever since we've been doing great.'
Maybe that's okay.
What is it?
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'  The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
But --
Have your department make a full report.
Cut that backsass!
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
You don't know!
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
So then you just call him.
I call.
A cold drink? Okay?
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
But damn if he don't look like a fat old Dragline.
Us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin' love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an' man -- stand back!
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
Call.
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
You ain't man enough to wear them!
Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry' coming up.
Get out!  All of you!
When was that?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
The door was already open...
What book?
You come and visit.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
I think this is number three...
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.  Where can I lay this stuff out?
How did you know they were stockings?
<u>He</u> won't.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
I just started it copying to tape, but the tape never ran.  It just did that...
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
You came in there with this attitude...
The woman's unstable.  You could wind up with a harassment charge. <u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny little teenager.
Shut up.
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
So I'm maybe gonna lose three good cops?  You fucked up on this occasion, but don't be so hard on yourself.  There's something I want you to think about.  The book says if you use your gun, use it to kill, that's what it's meant to do. You tried to pick this punk off with fancy shooting, to keep him alive.  To what end?  You're not willing to kill, you can't be a cop.  Go get drunk.  I am.
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
One of your suitors?
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
No.
The case could be made.
It's hospital policy...
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
You've only known Jake a few months.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
Just remember that I love him.
Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
Lie?
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
By color.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
Good God.
No rounds for another three hours.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
I don't like lamb.
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
Do you like it?
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
The restaurant, too?
Silly, silly, silly.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
She's only known the guy a few months.
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
Can you loan me a 20?
Sure. Why?
Yes, I suppose so.
This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
What does that mean?
I'll float you.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
I dunno.
Who?
Marcel?
Oui.
Uh, yeah.
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
It's Daniel.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Because you're the closest.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
We'll think of something.
Do I?
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
No.   Chicks dig me.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Guns.   Can you get them?
Why haven't you turned us in?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
What?
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
Good song though.
Go look.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Me?
Yeah.   It's mine.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
No shit?
Yeah, I dig him.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You wanna tell him?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
The lucky ones.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
What's it to you?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
So what if I don't?
Really?
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
No, really?
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
I will.
Jen...
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Did you see who posted it?
Well, we had talked...
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
I don't know...
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
I saw it, too.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
Well, how's your friend?
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Fine with me.
Whoa, hey, whoa.  Business.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
The night is young.
I'll be fine.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
At this hour? I don't think so.
Please.
Refreshing.
I never said that.
You implied it.
Thank you.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
It's my house.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Who?
Doing what?
And you promise to abide by it?
Somerset Maugham.
You must take me for a real idiot.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Good for you.
I love you.
I'm sorry about that.
Any ideas who it could be?
What do you mean?
No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
It's based on the life of Doctor Martin Luther King.
Doctor King is my favorite.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
I don't know.
Okay.
Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
But I thought high school is only four years.
You think he'll like it?
I look terrible.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
I'm taking a shower.
You do?
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Yes.
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
No.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Call me later.
No.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
Nothing.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
So what went wrong?
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
It was... Fantastic.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
I've never done this before.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
What about her?
You will be discreet about this?
Excuse me.
Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell.
Well please leave a message that I called.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
No. I only let her go with Edward.  It's alright.
Oh, lots of times.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
Yes, daddy.
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
It was on account of the birthday party.
Why didn't you run after them?
Because she is my friend.
In the garden? Would she be there now?
I don't know yet.
I've wanted a friend.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
But what happened to the little deer?
But I only came to give back the ring.
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
Yes...yes, that's true.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
And Amy mailed them?
So do I, Mr. Reed.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Can we get some service here?
I mean where on your body?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
Mom!
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
Maybe they have to pee.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you?
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.
I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me.
I've been here. What day is it?
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Did you get rid of Mark?
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
My apartment's just such a mess.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
This really isn't a good time.
On your desk.
Did you change your hair?
Very well then. Is that all?
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box?
What's that supposed to mean?
No, but thanks for the warning.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf.
Okay.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral.
No, I said it was our first date.
No, I have a cat.
She'll talk about PMS and stare at her salad.
And he was missing an arm.
Like a vampire or some shit?
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What makes her think that?
Yeah, Im like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure cant complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this aint no fucking rug! Ghead.  Feel it!  All mine!
How will we interrogate them?
You are mistaken.
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Which one?
It must be a closet or something.
You seem restless.
No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
I'm nothing then.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
That's easy.  You...
What?
Don't worry about it.
And we're going away for a holiday.
... Alright.
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Don't call the Vice President!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
Three years.
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
Bob...
Dave -- I'm working.
This is undeclared income.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Oh my gosh...
Oh, yeah... probably...
I'm not sure... I might have.
I see what you mean.
What?
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
Wrong...
Ah.
Certainly.
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
They asked me to help.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
I run a temp agency.
I know.
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
Then why did you come here?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
Look.
Quiet!
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
Look...I know you have no reason to trust me. I've got friends in the Cave. I got some stuff comin' out this mornin'. I'm gonna try to get off the island.
He's my contact for Chrissake! There's two crates. Can you get me into the hospital?
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
You are dying, too.
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
I'm alright. Let's go.
To fucking Mutt.
Knox?
They're townies?!
But why?
Needs Chris!  Must have Chris!
At Chet Danburry's house.
Yeah.
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
Wait a minute, Charlie. This should belong to the club.
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
I'm not?
This is better than sex any day.  This is romance!
It does?  What?
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
I'll be there.  The Danburrys.  Friday night.  Thank you, Chris.
But, Chris...
Are you going with Chet?
I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
My Word
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
A sweaty-toothed madman
Nothing wrong with research.
Then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  A dangerously self- destructive one.
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Yeah.
Yes sir.  I'm sorry.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
The god of the cave.
What?
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
No thanks.
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
That's it!  "Follow my voice.  We'll try no manhood here."  See you at dinner.
How do we get out of here?
He's the owner...
Boat or no boat...I'm going...
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
I have a schedule...
With who?
The thieves.
Then who are you?
He's with them.
You hear that?
Jesus Christ lady...
What are those things?
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
You people...rich people...
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
Takes one to know one.
You should talk...
Right...
And what if I run into one of those things?
I don't take orders at all.
He's not coming...
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
I have been.
How does an island sound to you?
One whistle... Start the engine...
Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
Like Mamooli's country...
What is it man?
Yeah.
They did too!
It's Nick!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
You gotta hit it here. Here, Albert, not there.
Worse since she talked to who?
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
No.
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Who's got the ammo?
Psst. Vince!
Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
No.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Yeah... I guess.
Pow?
Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
Here! This is it!
Right.
Same. Hey. Same old stuff.
Great. Hey. That's great.
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Phantom Mary?
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
Never one.
And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
I can smell it.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
Later.  I want Doucet first.
No, but he's going to be by tomorrow. He's aging.  'Bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  In that time he'll be an old man.  Could be a year, an hour, or all at once. Called NPA Syndrome.  Natural Pro- gression of Aging.  It affects each individual differently.  I'm sure it's painful.
When you bring in Doucet.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
Ah, fuck you, Wade.  This is bull- shit.  You're not going to kill me.  You're not going to risk your freedom.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
He could be brought back.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
Thanks.
Hey, I'm eating.
Yes, sir.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
You treat her nice.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
Take a look at this.
Yeah.
Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
Belle --
You know that you're in my house.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
It hasn't opened yet?
No! No! I won't.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Well, I --
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Camomile tea!
Yep.
Your butter money?
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Jabez!
Worried!
I'm serious.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
I don't know, Jabez.
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
All right, Jabez ...
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
Let him try it.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
I'll be there, too!
Me?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
I want someone to talk to ...
Why don't you?
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
So, you divorced of what?
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
John.
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Who are you, then?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
Put it down now.
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
When you're hot, you're hot.
Oh?  What idiot put you in charge?
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
Uh, what do I call you?
Thanks...partner.
It's a date.  You buy the ice cream.
They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground.
What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
Listen.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Jackie - what are you talking about?
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
So... that sure is something.
Yeah.  So how are you?
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Look... don't throw that on me.
Who's on the phone, now?  What do you mean... throw it on you?  You knew it, right?
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
That's good then.  You've found something.
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Right.  See you sometime.
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
I can't talk to him.
Who's this?
Call me whatever you want.
You frisk me.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Can't land ... you'd kill people ...
I want to talk to him.
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal.  Why don't I take it over now?
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Come on, lemme load you up...
Okay, don't worry about it.  Stick it in the bag...
I'm not going.  I'm okay.
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
What about Howard?
It was on the TV.
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
Yeah - it's all right... let's go.
But I want to know what you think.
We won't have to.
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
Get over there!
They gotta stop sayin' that.
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Okay, Sonny.
Okay, when do I get them?
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
He's right.  You shoulda done what he did.  Go home.  Don't talk to the FBI anymore.
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
What do you think, dumbshit?
<i>Promise me... you won't tell her... that I never fucked Pat Benatar.</i>
<i>The combination code is tattooed on his right arm. You'll never get inside Edna Fender's safe without the code-breaker on that arm.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Domino rides shotgun with her CELL PHONE to her ear.
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
Yes.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
<i>It was the beginning of the end.</i>
Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew Frank Sinatra?  I knew Frank.
Yeah. I played base guitar for Pat Benatar.
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
Son, with the exception of Spring Break in Tijuana, have you ever ventured outside of California?
We can't lose focus of Domino's journey, Mark.
Talk to me.
Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
I'm under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
You the man.
My name is Eddie.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
D, not C.
Tell ya father he makes the best heros in Brooklyn.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Run it then.
Tonight, when we close.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
C'mon, Sal.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
Motherfuck a window, Radio Raheem is dead.
Gotta go.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Your memory is really getting bad.
That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
Why you gotta curse?
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Be a man.
I am a man.
Later.
Hello, Sal.  Hello, Vito.
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
I'm listening.
How do you know this?
'Bout time, Pop.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
Wow just like Marco Polo.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Don't we want them to talk to us?
Can we eat there tomorrow?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
Your mom made a move on me.
I will stop this car right now.
You take that back!
Now you see why he was elected principal?
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
You can't marry my mom.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Shut up!
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
I know I did.
But my mom gave me the map.
Maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. Put it on.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
Right.
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
I know.
No.
Why are you teaching Special Needs? You're the lunch lady.
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
Me too. I'm almost there.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
I liked it a lot.
Oh honey, I wouldn't miss this for the world.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
What?
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
But we don't drink from the house do we.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Who's there?
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
With your permission...
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Yes.
Would you really have drawn my blood?
You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  In time you perverted the truth.  You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  How little you understand.
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
No.  I never drink -- wine.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
The old ones were much spookier. They had castles, full moons...
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
Dracula?
Let me take you to the hospital.
Goulash.
"It is my home."
"Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
So why didn't you do it?
Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.  Hey, toss me that J.D.
I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
I was thinking about killing myself.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
That's great.  Let's do a take.
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
What's to protect?  It was perfect!
Rolling.
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
Yeah.  It seems a little crazy, but sometimes <u>you just know</u>.  She's perfect for me.
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Hon', nobody's bothered but you.  Look around -- they couldn't care less.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
It's Wood.  Ed Wood.
Really?!  Well good for you.
I like to think so.
Tor!
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
I think you're quite handsome.
No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
Gee, I used every frame of film we shot.  Maybe they won't notice.
I just picked them up on the way over...
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
No! I love sex with girls.
Okay?
STOP!
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
Dynamite --
You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood.  I'm a film producer.  I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet!
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
Yeah...?
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
Yeah, so... ?
Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Uh-huh?
A woman wants to be pursued.
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
You said that.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
What?
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
No! And that girl has a name.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
But what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
Could've been a nurse?
She had white shoes.
St. Joseph's.
But Al is your husband now!
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
No.
She left.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Never would be plenty.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Shari, I really like you...
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Ohh...
...yeah?
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
What?
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault.
Who's Shari?
Hi.
No. Am I supposed to?
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
What...
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Here, get down.
You know what they say about the early bird.
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Right
As far as I know, they--
6:30.  How do you know what time the posters were torn down?
I'm looking at new cars.
Good for you.  Good for you
Even tried you at home.  We've got a situation here.
And when did you do it?
Door was open.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
It's the only true thing I know anymore.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Okay, let's say
I mean at you.
Thought what?
Hell, good luck!
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
What'd I do?
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
What's it to you?
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
Yeah.
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
Come in out of the rain.  In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
This business, Captain?
Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables.
Call me Dudley.
Dudley, what do you want?
It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
What work?
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Dudley.
What about him?
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Richard Stensland.
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl. I'm investigating.
That's right.
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
I don't know.  I swear it!
Believed what?
You ain't woofin' I did.  Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin' dog.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
He runs call girls.  Primo tail. Fixed up like movie stars.
No.
Yes, I do, sir.
A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
I'm snitching three old timers who'll be fishing in Oregon next week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And smart.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
Bud White's been here?
Not good enough.
You sound like you mean it.
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
What's Dudley's scheme?
Is she?
Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
I just called it.
Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
They found him yesterday folded neatly in a car trunk. What about Zavitz?
Yes.
I'm telling you, I--
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
I don't know what that means.
You're not.
I'm doing a transfer now.
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use.
Really?
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
That's who they are.
Wait.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
I called my wife!
How do you know so much?
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Yeah.
What's going on?
They're here.
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Fuckin-A.
What about newspapers and magazines?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea?
Neil, thank you for your help.
It's a little late for that.
What size?
I'll be right back.
That's my point.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
About the accident.
You tell me.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
No.
To buy lingerie.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back.
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
I'm looking at a picture of you and Rachel taken <u>yesterday</u>.
I know, but listen--
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
Oh Christ.
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
--otherwise we may have to--
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Brill.
Bobby--
Good point.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
I don't under--
What are you talking--
Where's mom?
She's in the kitchen.
Where've you been?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Christ!
Listen to me.
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Bobby--
Are you still in Crystal City?
What the hell does it mean?
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
What?
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
The originals?
Am I to understand--
Hiding something?
Help from whom?  Christ.
So they know everything.
If they've looked at the video.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
Explain that.
What's your ETA?
Yes sir.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.
Pardon?
Yes.  Absolutely.
You don't sew at all!
That makes it harder still.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
Yes.  Yes.  Absolutely.
Don't talk.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Or was it Toronto?
Bonjour.
I can get in the back.
And you've forgotten yours.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
For?
Is there a song you don't know?
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almsy smiles and walks on towards the others.
Very much so.  We are all, save my friend here.
I can see my wife in that view.
That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.

No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
So I follow the wires?
Don't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and then cut.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
It's what I've learned.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
No.  He's - no.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
Where are you at least?
Then don't.
Excuse me?
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Look on the back. What do you see?
I'm not the one to ask...
What's my problem? You want a list?
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
To our...partnership.
Behind you.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
They drive so recklessly there.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
It's never big enough.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
You know where my loyalties lie.
You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
Which one?
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
They did?
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Where's Anna?
Good.
Don't bother.
What medical records?
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
And you can't?
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Bullshit.
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
What?  Who?
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
So what are you thinking?
Erin, it's just a meeting.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Erin?  What are you --
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
You're married.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
There's more than one kind?
Have you been to the water board?
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
I do.
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
What?  But you been working so hard --
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
Mm-hm.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Everyone's invited, of course.
We're not out of this yet.
Not now, Chewie.  Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
Yes.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
What is it?
Where have I heard that before?
No lightspeed?
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
A mining colony.
Thanks to you.
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
Yeah, you're a real hero.
Thanks.
You're part of the mining guild then?
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
What are you talking about?
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
I want that ship.
They're...pretending to dress.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
He's a gorilla.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
Does he know how to activate it?
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Where?
Sewers. Come on.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
I will not.
I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
That's not why you came.
You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
I have come to claim what is mine, Father.
You freed it, son?
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
Me?
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
I will run.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
A lovestruck page!
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
Maybe... maybe...
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
To kill and be king, is that all?
Fuck it.
No, he's working on another book.
It might be best to have a man with experience. Maybe someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
Oh great, anything else?
Maybe the circuit is busy?
What is it?
Never mind.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
You're a nice man.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Why the math?
It affects concentration.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
You like it?
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Oh I love you.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
So what's next?
Oh, Christ.
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan?
No now.
Amen
I once did a paper on it
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
Is that a threat?
Who's in it?
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Bastards! Stop!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
You killed your mother!!! You left her alone to die!!!! She'll never forgive you!!! Bastard!!!
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Suit yourself.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Honey ...
Baker.
What's our friend's problem?
Teeth.
Five's my guess.  Maybe more. Won't know till I get in there.  Leave him now and you can pick him up in the morning.
Oh.
Recognize these two characters?
Wednesday next. Frank looks across the room at Jack.
How we doing?
Jack.
Jack.
Like an angel.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Fuck him.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
You got weird kids, Frank.
No, I mean it.
This time you gotta go.
Your older brother.
Her hands.  Like that.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
We don't get a gig.
That how you see it?
That's what we agreed.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?
Come on, stand still.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
First night?
Sunday.
A few bars!
Yeah.
Christ, can't you hear it?
Because I can hear it.
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
I don't know.
You don't know?
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
What?
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
The audience was a little off tonight.
Doctor's orders.
What am I gonna do?  Put a record player out there?  Bad, Frankie.  Bad.
Blanche.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Okay.  I think that's all we need to know.
When we know.
What I mean is --
We're a team.  We work together.
Changed?
What's wrong with it?
Am I missing something?
Hey!
Big feet.
I said I was sorry.
Did you hear it?
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Virgins?
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Jack?
Smells like fish.
Wow. You ever see her again?
Got another song for us?
Forget it.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
Not for money. With my mother.
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
His kid's sick.
Huh?
Forget it.
It's okay.  Last one.
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
In and out.
Just dinner and dance, right?
Look. You don't know good. All right?
How do you know?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Soap?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
You're kidding.
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
Yeah.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Oh, fine.
Eddie.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
We need to talk.
So you had a nightmare.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
You said it, Jon, not me.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
Of course I killed them, you DUMB FUCK.  And torched every shred of evidence that proves who you really are.  Swallow this one, Commander. You are going to be in here for the rest of your life.
I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.
Let's try to be a little less formal from now on, shall we?
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
-- Yes.
Check...
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
Kates my wife...
Its just two kids, right?
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
Yes you do...
I've got everything I need.
Thats my car!  You stole my car!
Basically, its my car now.  Get in.
No?  Cmon, Jack...Ive got everything I need, I dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
Something like that.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
All in one tape?
No, youre right.  What are we doing?
You hear me complaining about that?
I was in the city.
Telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
Because youll be here.
Youre kidding me...
Shes your dog, Jack.
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  But this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...
Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  Cmon, take it off.  Well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
I dont think Id fight you on that one...
Are you okay, Jack?
Jesus, Jack...
Dont get on that plane!
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Last night was great...
So we'll get egg nog.
This ain't permanent.  My friend Reed's working on a cure...I think.
No, I mean...I'm a little...dusty...
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Yeah, nine years straight.
Keep talking, there won't <u>be</u> a next time.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Later.  First, I've got some unfinished business.  A deal that needs closing...
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Reed, we're running out of time.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
I don't want to <u>understand</u> it.  This isn't one of your science projects.  I just want to <u>fix</u> it.  <u>Fast</u>!
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Of course.  Of course.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Why didn't you say something?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Just <u>find</u> him.
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
Nothing -- compared to starting it up again.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
What're you getting at?
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
Trip? Where to?
It's only for an hour --
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
Yes, Cora.
But big enough for us...
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval. The beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
A long time, with one man.
Doctor -- is it possible? That we're seeing it happen before our eyes?
Nothing -- against all that force.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
No, there's no other way.
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
Request removal, Mr. Grant.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Where we going?
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
Looks simple to operate.
Then don't drift down further.
Where's my daughter?
Can I see your license and registration please?
What?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
I need ...unguent.
We split that.
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
Three people. In Brainerd.
Oh, geez.
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Oh, yah? Twin Cities?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Yah.
Oh, yah?
You're not a C student.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
Yeah!
Oh, man!
Yah!
What's the next step here, Jerry?
Yah.
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Well... yah.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Ya got the car?
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
Yah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched for you and all. I got every confidence in you fellas.
Twice.
...Is everything okay?
Norstars.
I mean a parking lot.
No kiddin'?
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Yah, but think this thing through here, Wade. Ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? You gotta listen to me on this one, Wade.
Ah, dammit!
Well, that's okay, I just -
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
Yah?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah.
Yah.
Yah?
Yah - easy there - you do too!  I'm expecting, ya know.
Just a Diet Coke.
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Nope.
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
His wife?
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
Yah.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
- looking.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Prowler needs a jump.
Yah, ya think?
It's terrific!
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
Yah.
That's terrific.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Oh, my.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Congratulations, Jerry.
Where's Tyler?
I'm afraid I have to insist you leave.
Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
Really, what's that?
You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution.  They say he only sleeps one hour a night.  You know about this guy?  Tyler Durden?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
Does this sound strange to you?
Dynamite?
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
I'll expose you.
In case we want to switch nights.
I found a new one.
Really?
I'm just on my way out...
So you're staying in tonight?
Here.
When?
What do you get out of it?
Guy or girl?
What kind of stupid question is that?!
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
You are an insane person.
Don't ask.
Oh, yeah.
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Is this a test, sir?
You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
No, supply oxygen?
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
How's that working out for you?
Being clever.
I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
Is it a problem for you to ask?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
Alive or dead?
You?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
Don't mention me.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
"Applicant?"
I can't let you...
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Green?  Did you say green?
Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  You need to get with the program.  Seven minutes.  Let's get out of here.
Defuse the bomb?
Yes.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
No!
Irvine?  Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
Really?
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry, once the others are dead, it'll come back for you.  Always does.
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
I...I...
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
How you doing in there, hero?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Jorge.  When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
No, I'm good.
For Christ sakes girl, take a breath.
I...I don't know.
I know, honey.  I just --
Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
Most kids never have it happen.
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
What just happened?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
No.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
One hundred.
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
Let me see.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
I do?
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
What?
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
Can you walk?
I could take it or leave it.
Am I out of here?
What did you want?
Meeting ... people.
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
You're all right... you sure...
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
Where?  Maybe we can.
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
Come on now...You can't sit here.
I... I was just leaving.
Good.  You believe this drunk?
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE "AND" THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT...
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
Parry... I'm Jack.
I know...
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
You're totally gone, aren't you?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Sure...
In a bar called Hellfire.
I'm still scared.
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
I don't drink coffee...
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
No.
No.
Serveza yourself!
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form...
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
Fill it up.
Alaska? Are you on vacation?
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
Hi, Tita.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Sort of.
Like what?
What?
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
If you're free.
Thank you.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
I think it's what you think.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
I don't believe vou.
What?
I'll be back later...
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
Just give me a chance, will you?
Yes.
Your serve. Two -- Eighteen.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
What?
Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
I'm wit' Carlos.
I, umm, came to see you.
You look good.
Oh, 'cause you got it like dat?
I can't!
These are the pretty girls you told me to come down for?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
How old is he?
Yeah.
Wha'?
I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.
You sure?
Positive.
Nothing.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
My God, you're serious.
That a boy.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Well, which one?
Funny old bird.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Just relax....
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
I guess not.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
Wait a minute! Our problems might be solved.
What?
'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'
Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
My parents were great fans of the former President.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
They busted me last week.
Sure you did.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
So why pick me?
You doing a story on this guy?
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
I'm sorry?
His bride. Cute as a button.
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little.
John Ultramalensky?
Hi.
I was hoping you'd say that.
You were in the war?
Can I ask you a question?
Good point.
No.
You can't do that.
I recommend it.
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
I'm her cousin.
Tell the cops.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
Irwin...
What about finding the source?
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
What?  Who the hell are they?
What...
My secretary.
I said, I ain't got you...
I ain't -- got -- you.
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Hold that thought.  Are we being shot at?
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
You're a fucking gentleman.  What do you want from me?
I like.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
You gave it to the girls for one.
Hey, they blew me.
Oh.  Three hundred coming right up.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
Zuzu, be quiet.  Put in Colleen's disc.  Number two.
No, wait...
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
I'm off it!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Why thank you.  It's a Christmas present.  That was my sense of humor, everyone.  I wish you would fake a laugh.  It's easy with a deaf person.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
That's funny, you're cute.
Mr. Doyle.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
Sal --
What?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
Si tu veux.
Avec a tu pourras le supporter.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis pass voir Franoise.
Une erreur!  C'est gnial.  C'est une vedette  la tlvision.  Il peut aller partout sans tre souponn... En plus il a besoin de fric.
We have four rooms and six suites on six.  There's a man in almost every one of them.
Willie Mays.
Tumble it.  One end to the other.
How'd I know he had a knife.
He coulda been white.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
For garbage?
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Elvis has left the building.
I think I ruined the sauce...again.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
The usual.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I love you more.
So am I.
Luck, my ass.
Hello, Frank.
No, I don't.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Queens, New York.
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Oh, that was my kid.
What'd you say your name was?
29-years ago.
What?
You just burned the desk.
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Nah, I gave it up.
I lost you.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
I'll warn them.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Whatta we do now?
What are we like in...1998?
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
It's not your fault, Dad.
Johnny, I know, but...
Okay, okay...
Call the FBI.  Use a pay phone.  Don't give 'em your name, Dad.  Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others.  That he's the Nightingale.
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Yeah.  Sure.
I try to be.
A hot shot, huh?
Where are you going?
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
Drop me off?  How do you mean?
"He" wanted me to warn you.  Look at this, all of you!
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
You're too clean for me.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
It's Friday the 13th.
I don't know.
Nothing.
Sure, just watch where you're going.
You're Shelly?
You don't "have to."
You're wrong.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Whaddya mean?
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
Yes, Megan.  Tommy Jarvis is a killer.  A very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
It's just beginning.
Huh?
Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
Jason's not in his coffin!  Hawes is!  Dig it up!  You gotta dig it up!!
Please don't do anything crazy.
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
Yeah, that'd be a big shame...
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
I'm scared.  I'm very scared.
Look, I don't want your money!
Do you have to ask?
Okay.
I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
Gotta go.  See you guys later.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
He was dead.  He had to be dead...
You don't know shit!
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
He bought you that?
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
I guess not.
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
Ask me in about five minutes.
And you'll never do it again.
Rennie's not coming.
What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
Perfectly.
I packed it. Just for us.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
But Sean said...
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
This isn't a request.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
Forget it. It's a dumb little thing anyway.
The bow...front of the ship. There's a hoist on each side that lowers them
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
I don't want to hear about it.
Shut up, Elliot.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Tonight. What's tonight?
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
What about the haircut?
She was very evasive.
Can he get through it?
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
Because we're completely mismatched.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
Except I won't have a father anymore.
First you tell me.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
All right. What's been going on?
Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
That's always been my problem.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
Alma Wetzel.
A thousand things.
Life is real.
Where the hell are you?
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
I can't find it.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
I know, Pop.
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
Oh yeah?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
I think I remember.
Oh. You know him.
He goes to the theater armed.
I haven't come to you.
Eleven.
Some of it good, I hope.
Well, we shall try.
Did they take your clothes?
Ah, but my puritanism runs the another way. I'm far too modest for such a display.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
A -- a week.
It was one incident.
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
No... no. In every temple and mosque they have pledged to die before they lift a hand against each other.
That was England.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
It would be five thousand more.
No?  What's keeping you?
I'll see what I can do.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
Something's not right.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
Suit yourself.
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
Again?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
I've found him too.
I know about you.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
Of course.
We'll get it later.  Irene, please.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
We could go together one day.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
I'll take care of my end.
And you got him...
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
No applause!
What do you add up to here?
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Better than old times.
I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
Sure.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
That doesn't hurt.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
I don't want to go there.
We keep going.
I didn't mean police.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
Twenty eight hundred.
No scars.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
We walk.
Me, neither. There's about twelve people in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm one of them.
Suit yourself.
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
He took the day off.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
You got it.
I know.
Nothing. What could I do?
What's it got to do with you?
How'd it happen, then?
Good evening.
That's nice.
I want to talk to you later.
He was all right to me.
I call that regular.
Really?
He was here for four days.
Could you please put my glass on the table?
And what was that?
You've been watching the film.
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
No. It's all right.
You coming to South America?
Since when did he drink whisky?
How'd you find me?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
You sure?
Funny.  Can I phone London?
No. Really, I am.
No.
Pension him off.
No.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
No, I didn't know that.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Very...  So, who you working for these days Eric?
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
Yeah.
That's right, Harry.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
You ever get 'em?
It's too...
Who?
No.
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
He's doing very well.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Starting up.
You...
Should do something to them.
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
Have I said that?
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
You...
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
What does that mean?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
Yes.
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
I want to work today, that's why I came...
The leads come in, I'll let...
Just go to lunch.
Did they get my contracts?
How the fuck do I know?  What...talk to me.
You have a problem?
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
The people downtown said...
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
Roma.
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
You know what those leads cost?
Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
John.  John...
I'm out.
Then put me on the board.
I will close.
Twenty percent.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Is that it?  Is that it?  You want to do business that way...?
The deal still stands, our other thing.
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...
Ricky?...That I don't care they stole the contracts?
Last night, this morning.
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Ricky...
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll tell you what it is, and I know that that's why you married her. One of the reasons is prudence. It's a sizable investment.  One thinks twice...it's also something women have.  It's just a reaction to the size of the investment. Monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  This woman can cook...
Of course you have three days.
I don't understand.
What was yesterday?
What is?
I told you.
I...
What...?
I don't have the power.  I said it.
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
They took 'em...
Mr. Lingk and I are going to...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Just a few days.
I can help you.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
Michael...
These Eye-ties are really crazy when it comes to their wives.
You would risk your life for strangers?
Not for strangers; for my country.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.  No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
We were all upset about that.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
It was hard to have him killed.
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
The old man will never bring in the New Year.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
That's off now.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
Why didn't someone tell me!
I took care of it.
Wait... there's something else.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
Do you gamble?
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Thanks...friend.
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
Sleeping inside me.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
Yes.
What a mistake; people behaving like that, with guns.  It was my understanding we left all that behind.  But, let me tell you, the important thing is that you're all right.  Good health is the most important thing; more than success; more than power; more than money.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
The money was sent.
That is a complete falsehood.
And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
He supports me.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
I won't keep you another minute...
Fuck you.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
Sure.  I loved it.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
You proposing what I think you're proposing?  Don't you think I'm a little young for you?
Of course.  I am married still.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  I only hope you did not get him excited.  It could give him a new stroke.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
Nice place.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
What was wrong?
Yes.  You were a Marine.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
It's new.
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
I don't like to talk about that.
Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
You asked me to model.  Remember?
I want -- I want...
I don't hear anything.
Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
You're planning a trip?
I don't know.
Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
After you then.
Nice.  And your lighting and camera angles.  You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it.
Of course.
Right.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
I knew you'd say that.
"don't want" the Dodgers to lose or the summer to end. But we don't get to choose these things...
How's Atley -- ?
You'll leave -- ?
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
Kip.
Yeah?
C'mon, man ...
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
You know where the others are?
I know. Weird, huh -- ?
It's arright ...
Remember who my brother is?
You getting my checks ... ?
Of course ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
You remember that, Kip?
Oh, for God's sake
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
I heard you were pumping gas -
Okay --
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
No problem -
Hospital.
DO IT! NOW -- !
Buy you a drink?
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
What's wrong with her -- ?
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No ... ?
No. Open her ...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
I do ... I cut "em...
No worries ...
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
She left...
Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up
Who's "Eleanor?"
Not --
Shit all looks the same here --
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Billy, how are you?
Busting his balls?  If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
No. No. The guy from downtown.
Why would I get into that?
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
I got seared.
Jimmy. He'll be okay. He's good for it. Relax.
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Jimmy.
We did it.  We did it.
There are cops all over the place.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Will you stop.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
No, no. It's okay.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
I got dry cleaning.
But, Paulie, please.
I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to.
Oh shit.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
Yeah, you're all invited over to Morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
Don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. WILL I don't know, Chuck. It's kinda outta the way.
Why didn't you yoke him?
I wanted to meet your brothers...
I told you "no" yesterday!
I'm Irish.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
No students work for me.
Which one's your building?
I'm sorry.
Really?
Yes. Under two conditions.
That's right.
--that?--
--Half-red, half-black--
Will, this is Sean Maguire. Sean, Will Hunting.
Pleasure to meet you.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Good to see you.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Why would he do that?
I think so.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
Who?
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
--Gerry--
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Yes. The pressures you feel, and again, I am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. So stop the Tom Foolery -- the Shenanigan's, Will.
Like what, Will?
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
I know, but the joke's better if I tell it in the first person.
Why not?
Well I think that's a wonderful philosophy, Sean. That way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
They could see that I meant it.
What did you think?
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Don't give me you line of shit.
I didn't want the job.
Look at me. What do you want to do?
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
The wrench, why?
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
I'm Will.
Okay, you got me. It's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
Sure.
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
How many?
What, five?
Your house must have been a zoo.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
All the time. We all live in Southie. I live with three of them now.
When?
No.
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Just for fun?
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
Yes, I do, Will.
I never cared about that.
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
People done it. If they could, we could.
Sure, but what is this?
Four.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
They never wrote you nothing?
What's the matter? What's happened?
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Got any plants?
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Look, Ma!
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
You promised, Tommy.
What's that--detour?
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
He was a good man.
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
Man bones?
Some, I guess, but mos'ly cow bones.
Please don't.
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Now don't you go monk'ing--
You people looking for work?
In the corporate offices.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
So, what are you doing now?
Computer guy.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
That's it?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
You met people.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
I just know.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
This is me breating.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
It's only natural....
Like a union?
Thank you, no.
Here. Take my card. Wait a minute... here's a special one. For top-shelf clients.
I don't think so.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
If he does our job, he's our job.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Patch him through....
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Doesn't matter.
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Oh yes. I forgot.
Need a lift?
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
It is. It's lovely.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
I won't ask you to.
Okay.
Doesn't matter.
Yeah?
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Good.
No.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
You're allergic to hay.
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more.  But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore...  And I don't want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
No. I am a "tubab."
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
Yes, it does.
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
We should be fine, then.
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
I thought your mom's coming up?
I'm okay... I'm okay.
Oh yeah...
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Waste the dude.
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Yeah?
Up all night again, huh?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Razor and Blade.
Joey's getting stupid busy.
What?
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Yeah.
Your slave?
Make it our first date.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Wanna go for a swim?
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
What's happening?
Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.
I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
Virus?
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Thank you.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
Well you found out this morning? Why didn't you tell me before? I mean it's 5 o'clock now Rachel...shit
I don't know!
No. You son of a bitch!
Can't you find somebody else?
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
I can't.
Hi Jamie.
You won't look pushy.
Do you?
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you?
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
I forgot my chemistry book.
Why did you hang up on me?
I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
Probably Mister Riddle.
Yes, you can.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Totally...
And I can't keep you interested?
YEAH?
Yeah, sure.
Lee Brackett.
I am.  I met him fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. I met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when I realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
There was no one outside.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
But you can't kill the bogyman.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
It means... I see.
Mmm?
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
What?
You're joking.
I cry at the opera.
It's terrific!
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Yeah.  It's kind of a weird place, actually.  A lotta wall space. 
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
...cannot go on the air.
Oh, Elliot!
What are you doing here?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
Uh, yes!
He's got like six gold records.
Lee!  Lee!  Lee, I'm in love with you.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
Poor Hannah.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
I didn't sleep all night.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Are you?
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
Get his wine away.
So?
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Why?
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
I can't keep my mind on the show.
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
Oh, now-- 
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
I got two minutes.
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Okay.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Yeah.
I should get a garter belt.
I know, no--  I know.
Yeah.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Oh, so loosely.
I can't hear you.  I can't hear anything.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear!  I'm--
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
I'm fine.
Yeah?
Remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a... 
No, I haven't.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Hmm.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault.  I-- 
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Hmm.
Uh-huh.
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
...<u>please</u>...
I have not read you your rights.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
...very good.
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
...why?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
And who is "they?"
What's new onna street?
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
...his family has offered a large reward.
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Somewhere in Italy.
Waal, Nobody's <u>Perfect</u>... What do we hear from our songbird in Switzerland?
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
...unmarked hundreds....
...what'm I looking at...?
Am I on that case, sir...? 
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
Well, perhaps sometime we...
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
...yes, yes, yes...
With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.
Yes.... yes...
Is it necessary to know?
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
<u>Perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
Why should <u>you</u> care?
...which of us is free...?
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
Oh baby, oh baby....
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
Yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  Howabout you, Romeo...?
...not to turn around.
You're going to <u>do</u> that?
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
Because...?
....because we don't have any mmm...
I know where he is.
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
Brazilian. 
...I feel that...
"A liaison position with the Opera." 
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
And.  I always said, he was a <u>P'lice</u> officer.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
You have no idea. Now run away.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
Nothing.
Yeah. And?
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!

Betty Finn. Gosh.....
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
You did last night.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
I made your favorite. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
Yeah, I just got back.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
Suicide is a private thing.
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
You're not funny.
Yeah. Scary stuff.
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
I was just making it more special.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
I thought I...you..
Answer him dick!
Let's kick his ass.
Goddamn Geek!
Lighten up, dude. In those woods is some of the finest pussy in the school and we don't even have to buy it a hamburger and a Diet Coke. Punch it in!
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.

Well, I guess I take after you then!
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
You have to let me go!

looks down at the ground in front of her.
Thank you so much!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
What??
Let's go overseas . . .
You mean travel by ourselves?
Yes . . .
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
Bull...
No.
What?
I quit. Today's my last day.
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
Someone special.
Ambrose. I know.
I've been in here before.
Where's Allison?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
What?
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
Music to my ears.
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Really?
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
The homeless!
Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
...unworthy of the adoration.  We all do.
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Uh, right.  A... news story.
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
You didn't?
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
You didn't... get it on with him?
I didn't ask him.
Who?
Any particular brand?
Actually, I have met someone. There's a woman I think I like.
Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
Who doesn't?
Well, can I make an appointment?
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Holly -- that's not so.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
What?
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
Huh?
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Well, what about <u>these</u>?  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
This is my house.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
And I can't help having a cold.
Can we keep him?
Even cosier.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
Congratulations.
It's late.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
What else?  What else do you hear right now?
I see.  You don't care about life anymore.
Then she should be an excellent dancer.
So, you do this for yourself?  What about her?  You cannot not have a relationship, Macleod.  You've told me of your wife, Heather, and how you loved her. Romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  You watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
That doesn't matter.
She's a treasure she is.
Sometimes.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
It will end tonight.
Sounds very -- normal.
How could they get by him?
I don't think it is a duplication.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
My dreams died long ago.
I think he's dead!
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
No way.  I tell them, that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Shut up, goddamnit!  Just calm down!
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
There is no way out.
Kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
If you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
You can't run with suitcases.
I overheard him with the girl.
What do you mean?
I think you got no choice.
You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
Yes.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
Go, Chief.
Tell her I'm almost home.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Maddox!  You got that?
Chief, it's Mikkelson.
Go, Mickey.
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Can you get into the office?
Who is it?
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me.
I am always glad to see you Paul.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Stay with the children.
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
How can we help him.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
A kiss.
What sort of car?
Please, please try one more time.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
What's wrong?
You have taken business class?
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
And how the hell are we going to do that?
-- I'm sure you did.
-- what was he doing here?
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Prove it how?
Most fun I've had all day.
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
-- where the hell were you?
He's gotta still be down here.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Where is she?
Funky little house, ain't it?  Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have.
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
-- my loss --
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
What're you talking about?
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
I was just sitting here -- it happened. I had nothing to do with it.
What's going on?
Keep talking, I'll find you!
-- I'm coming --
Suppose not.
I'm scared!
He's blessing the house.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Were you fooling with the power?
Didn't you just see the power go off and on?  I just had a bulb break on me!
Should I...
No.  You two are the most important things in my life.  I don't ever want to lose you.
Know what?
We're not going.
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
What are you getting at!
It will not take long...
There's something through that wall!
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
That's great.
Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
What on earth were you doing down here?
Buying some drugs, alright?
No.  Thank you.
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
I miss you too.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Something like that.
Gum.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Hey, get this irritable guy a cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
Why try?
Get em....
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
You're supposed to be dead!
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Because Danger, Doc, is my middle...
Said.
It's also been a long time for me.  I--
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
What job?
If you think you're getting past me...
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
If you do anything to my friend...
No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
The Hoop-dee-doo!
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
Why yes, do you know it?
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Now, Aim --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Consider this my resignation --
Phony, huh?
Tell me about it.
I thought you served misfits here!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Yes sir...
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
Oh my God, sir!
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Damnit, where's my car!
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
Where?
You mean Mama Rose was like Mrs. Holland?
Thank you.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
I like her already.
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
We're half-brothers.  Paul is mother's first child.  When his father died, she married my father. Dr. Rand, the missionary.  And you know what they say about missionaries' children.
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
I've never given it much thought.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
Instead -- you come, with sympathy, Betsy, and a generous heart. Don't forget that.  Don't call it nothing.
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
It's more than that, Doctor.  I've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods...
Ah -- that's where reason took hold.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Why?
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Got a meeting uptown.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
Don't be dim.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
That this was going to be a key party?
I'll drive you --
Paul? Yeah. You think --
Classes?
All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
What are you talking about?
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
Nah.
What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
Huh?
Yeah.
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
It was all junk!
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
Well, we can talk about it.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
It'll warm you up.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
Now you are being rude.
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
Moisture! Moisture!
Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
It's freezing.
Sure.  Twinkie?
Yeah. Yours?
Yeah.
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Her name's Libbets.
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
They left it in the jungle.
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
I don't know. How do I know?
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Yeah.  All over.
Okay.
Around twelve-thirty.
Has her books in it.
That's right.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
You know my plan of action.
You know I remember that.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
No way.
Huh?
You heard me that time.
After that she left the party to go to him.
The phone call.  The knapsack.
Oh?
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Told you I could write an ending.
This an accident, Walter?
Your lips, they didn't move.
What are we?
Who made us what we are?
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
We can do that?
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
We forgive each other then?
What have you done?
He jests.
You both did it?
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
Yes...
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
You want death? Is it death you want?
Why should I be?
But why do you want me?
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
I didn't want to kill her.
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
Yes. I remember...
You have it...
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story. I've had a very unusual life.
Why should I lie? 1791 was the year it happened. I was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
But times were different then. I was a man at that age. The master of a large plantation just south of New Orleans...
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
He did it to make you stay with him!
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
We haven't exchanged anything.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
Some.
Can't what?
Ray...please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
Who?
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
It's...him.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Oh, no...Did you say Rio?
How much?
He leave you?
And so could you -- crazy fool.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
Yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
No one can take my father's place.
That should decide it or you --
I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life you've ruined mine 
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints  the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
You wouldn't tell that 
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.
What is her illness?
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
The General threatened me.
Well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
Well, all right . . .
Yeah, very funny.
Go through with what?
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Our clothes are dry.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Made what?
Where's Mary?
Who is it?
Yes, but what happened to George?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Splendid! Is he sick?
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Looks like we'll have to send someone down  a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
When'd you see him last?
Want to give my flower a drink.
I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Fine.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Nice girl, Mary.
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm?
And all's fair in love and war?
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Well, no younger than I was.
Huh?
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
They're not my children.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Me?
Uh-huh.
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
Ummmmm . . .
Well, then, sit down.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Yeah, just started.
But of course.
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
We'll take your supercargo.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
It's still there!
Till noon.  This is on my own time.  Hi, Shorty.
Rich people.  Home port is Newport, Rhode Island.
Bartending?  I'm 17.
What?
Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing.  You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up.  Here's a test I did....
You're damn right that's what it is.
Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
Late.
Home it is.
So's a donut.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Sean's asleep.
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
We're alone.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
Perfect.  Look at this ---
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Brody?  This is Patrol Base.
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Did he raise the Kids?
Dad!  Dad!
Me neither.
Who'd you ask?
You got it.
All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn, Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all that whole gang.
I'm going.
Anything?
I can go out if I want to.
Take me.
Look, what am I supposed to do? It's done, it's over.  We have to deal with the consequences.
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
You buying?
How many sharks have you killed?
Yeah.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
Not enough loving.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Are you scared?
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
And leave me down here???
After what happened to us?
What's that?
Why?  'Cause they're hungrier?
We'll go to Palm Springs, Death Valley, Arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
I need more pressure in the shark tank.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
... Okay.
Only to myself.
I'm  fine.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
Well, then I'm going to film it.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
What in hell is that?
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Get ready to go.
Believe me, I am.
How'd it get in here?!
Sure.
Hope with none of my girl friends.
Someone's looking for you.
Massachussettans aren't.
How long you staying?
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
The one that goes underwater?
Goes up.
He's diving!
Can't help it... ahh...
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Yeah, poor bastard.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
You have a man near it?
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
So was Dad.
Yeah, right.
You know Overman?
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
Absolutely.  The audience will stain their drawers.  I did.
That's what grandmas are for.
Watch me, Grandma....
We forgot to stop at the store.
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
No....
You caught me....
I'd be afraid of losing....
Spent it all on beer....
We're going down.  All of us....
Good.
Where's the lady who brings the soda?
You guys must be starving....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
You're not a pain in the ass....
I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
I don't want to talk about that.
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
I always listen to my feelings....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
Will you leave me alone...?
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
The females have eggs....
Put me down....
Forget it....
Okay...we got it together....
What she's got.  Nine knots....
Maybe it's gone....
I'm going down, Jake....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
How come only me?
I don't like the song.
Mom....
No way....
Here it comes....
We're out of decaf...We're out of petty cash...And we're out of requisition forms....
Yes.
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Is it your vehicle?
Two dogs. He should do the dogs.
Because I dislike her too much ..
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
You looked like you did?
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...
<u>One hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. And you know why? Coz I never told her good-bye. O.K.? Is that good enough for the "committee?"
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
I'm going up to the institute.
What d'you mean, "bits."
I thought it was Taylor's case?
Kid told me he didn't take it?
How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
Well, her, it ain't. That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
My hands?
Yes, I could smell it on his breath, like I can on your's.
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Fifty-seven .. I don't mind ..
I know about alcohol, John.
I don't want them to arrest you.
It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
Yes, Sir.
Who sought the warrant?
The man from the F.B.I.
You find something curious in that?
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Even better.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Ask him.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
I know about the bachelor party.
Ugh!
Okay, this is working.
Could you just stop moving?
No.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Well, take care.
No no. I knew.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Well, I'm happy for you.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Mission... statement...
You don't have to explain.
Bye you guys. _ 88.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
No--
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
Huh?
Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...
No, I'm saying to be --
Hey, that's my word, okay?
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
No, you're --
What --
To the pools?
Not a chance.
What DO you stand for???
Pleasure.
You'll lose.
Funny.
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Quiet!
No, Dr. Grant says...
What did you say?
I filmed this the morning they left.
We have to help him.
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Baryonyx?
NO!
I try not to.
Goodbye, Alan.
Yeah.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
This plane can not land!
Stan.
Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
How do you mean?
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
Not without a shot of the nest.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Which one?
That was about a year ago.
On the side of that one truck.
How close do you have to be?
Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
Possible.
You're going too?
I don't know these guys, but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers, French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em, sink our boats, and then call us crazy.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
I'm her father.
John Hammond.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
I believe in him.
Damn!
The door security systems are shutting down.
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
Uh - - about two million.
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike.  Is that okay?
Six weeks?
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Could I have a tissue please?
John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
John....
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
They know very little about the Jurassic Period they know less about the Cretaceous.
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Yeah.
Hola, bienvenido
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
In a box under my seat.
Yeah.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Oh, yeah - - great.
That's a good idea.
Try to!
Why?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Are you two, uh - - are?  I wish you the best luck.
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
I know.
Let's get outta here!
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Alright.
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
You're right, John.  You're absolutely right. Everything's my problem.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
Why did you do this?
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
No, no... listen, when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things, Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
Who is this? What's going on?
What about that other guy?
That's my job.
Who?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Insomnolesence...
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
You're not going to be there?
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
-- In what sense?
Why do you work in that hideous insurance office?  -- dealing with people who fall off ladders.  Now take me -- I make my living as a stone mason.  It's not my art -- but it's the <u>tools</u> of my art.  You could be -- a journalist.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
Yes.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
You're detestable.
Well, I --
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
What?
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
I have no right to be, I know.  My experience with real life  is practically nil.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
You don't believe that.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Eight -- and seven months.
He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
What did she say?
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
And we're upset too.
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
Kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, Miss Darrow. All we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to reduce my handicap.
Miss Darrow ... I've been thinking. I would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. It's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. Truly a wonderful man.
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
Y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
Yeah.
Compassion.
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
You think people hate you.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
No, not Grunemann. He's dead. The man that killed him -- also prob'ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Well we're pretty --
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
-- OK?
It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
You said you wanted these.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me.  You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
What?
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
I believed her, Pete.
Where, how?
I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
Goodbye, Pete.
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Trask --
Yes?
What does?
Soon.  Very soon.
Sure.  Didn't I ever tell you French toast was my specialty? I'll bet I never told you that. Now then, the first thing we need is...  ... eggs!  Right?
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
What if she forgets?
We use the green and yellow.
I'm sorry.
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
I hate it.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
I'm allergic to onions.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
Dad?
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
No, she never did.
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
And yet you chose to leave him?
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
No.
No.
I...I don't know...
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
What about Billy?
C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
Fine.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Yes, what?
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
What?!?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Oh, no..
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son?
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
Got it.
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
I don't mean a little favor. mean a big F favor.
Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
Are you? Of whom?
I will buy them for you.
Are you, General?
The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
With much bloodshed.
I miss him too.
No. This war is almost over.
He warned about the future of Tibet.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
Is he a bad man? Norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "How can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
But you will always be here?
You will always!
Is that a true story, or pretend?
True.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
No, Holiness.
Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
Much too young.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
We both know what they'll do.
That's actually the easy part.
We're ready.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
Tranq guns down, rifles up!
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
They won't.  He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
'Night.
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
<u>I'm</u> <u>not</u> <u>mushing</u> <u>it</u>.
Okay.
You wouldn't?
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Not yet.
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
What the hell?
Crocodiles.  He's an expert on them.  And if he's <u>here</u>... then he must think that's what's in this lake.
<u>Apologize</u>?
I asked you to be nice to him.
<u>That</u> was a bust.
Look ten feet into the water.
That it's about to go wrong.
Else.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
Are you on drugs?
Kelly--
Liar?
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
He's here, Ardelia.
'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
Sometimes.
Shut UP!  The other officers will be here any minute! you're perfectly safe now!
I see.  Let's make this quick, then. I'm busy.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
Yes sir.
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Murdered...? How?
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
Starling -
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?  Do you think she could've had a friend you didn't know about?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
It's much better than your shoes.
All flayed...?
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Yes.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
No! That's incidental.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs... outside...
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
Absolutely.
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
He did?
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Yes. Yes, I will.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry?
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
Then what?
: Only one or two loads.
We'll see in the morning...
By your leave, sir.
Thank you. How can I reward you?
Webb's at Edward?
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Allow me to consult with my officers.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Intelligence may not be the right word...
No!
Just get in yours!
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
You screw around like that again and--
Seeing how my stock's doing...
I can't see them!
Where's Doc?!
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
No...she killed herself.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Twelve hours, no big deal.  We should know something first thing in the morning.  Don't worry.
I signed-up for the stock option.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
I'm going to try to remove it.
No fuckin' lie...
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
Oh man, that's just great...
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Apart from those shotguns.
Like antiques.
I don't know what you mean.
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
Let's have a look, shall we?
That's no way to answer the phone.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
What the fuck is going on?
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
I mean it's fucking empty.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
You will what?
I will loan you the money.
And that does include the amp?
Nick the Greek.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
Er, well, twelve.
How the fuck should I know?
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
What do you mean?
I'm sorry, sir.
Please.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Chaos.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Will this go on my record?
You're testing me?
You know the popular version of how he left town.
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
He swore by it.  What?
There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
No. You?
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
Come on in--
He a Black man or an Indian?
Same as they done in Mexico.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
Seriously.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
Substance abuse?
Appreciate it, sir.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
Right.
What's in the back?
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
We don't need a new jail.
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
Bledso
He still living?
Hey, Sam.
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
If you spent a little more time training them--
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
No. Is he sick?
Enough with the clothes--
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
We haven't talked since high school.
So what are we gonna do about this?
I've felt that way, yeah.
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
Yeah--
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
Me neither.
I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
How?
You ever been married?
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
That's so cool.
Beats me.
I don't know.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Will you come to him on your knees?
Yes...
Be ready.
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Do you?
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
That's my business. Harry.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
Jennifer Desiderio, for one.  She threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
It was more than that, I think.
Stuff?
What then?
Yes.
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
Somebody killed him.
Oh God.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Mr. D'Amour?
Maybe I just bought it.
What's the difference?
Yes.  It's regrettable
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
What about?
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
Sure.  Vivovich.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Have you been in?
Fuck.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
And he's dead?
Binding you.
Ok.
Yeah, I'll stay.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I don't know.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
Yeah, you don't remember?
Ok, whatever you want.
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
You are.
Do you know where we are?
Well... have a good flight.
Oh?
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
Do you want to- 
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
Ok, I will... later.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
Sure.
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I don't know.  What are they?
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
My secretary?
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
Listen to me, Peter.  You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
Yes, I know.
Yes.
Sure.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I'm not waiting until it's too late.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers.  And you're already wrong on one count.
Viznick will get off and Michael's got a crush on you.
Get out of here.
There weren't any voices.
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
What happened?
I can't eat before a game.
Nothing.  So good luck.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
That's ridiculous.
She's alright.
You're cold?
Careful.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
Why not?
To do what you love.
Mom's going to hate it.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
No.
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
So how's the job going?
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
I never knew a girl that could play.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
So?
And?
You either.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
I know, right?
You do see me standing here, right?
Clothes.
I've been trying to find you all day.
It happens, right...
You want to go talk?
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
What are the doctors saying?
Oh yeah?
What do you mean?
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
What?
Then why are you so upset?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
So you're gonna bitch up?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
What's that, not great?
We still have to go?
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Okay.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Why not?
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
I ain't a damn liar.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Sure is.  So why call me?
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
He's not my boyfriend.
No.  No.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
I'm coming!
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
It's fine.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
Yeah.
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
It's my favorite place --
It's fine.
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
That was so great what you just said.
I've got troubles.
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
Can you hold it?
Bite it, Cynthia.  You could get free things from people that want you to endorse their products.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
That's confidential information, little man.
No Can Do.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
I'm a rapper.
Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's real helpful Ice-T.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.
Well --
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
Brad, dear?
Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
I'm sick.
Gently, son --
Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly --
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
And that's what you've heard?
I'm quietly judging you.
Do you have your masters?
In five years?
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
Uh-huh.  What's going on?
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
I don't think, he can't...
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
No one else in here?
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
You on any medication?
Been drinkin' today?
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
Did you tell her?
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
How long with Ellen?
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
Well maybe.
Do you know the answer to this?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
Did you ever touch her?
I'm her father.
It's alright.
What's MOW?
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Well.  Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
Shut the fuck up.
mmmhmm.
...I don't....
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
Maybe.
Stand up.
Why did you do this?
It's ok.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
Nothing... Nothing.
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own.
I see that is a body!  But where did you get it?
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
Three days??!!
The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
But -- but --
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --
Athos, my friend!
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
Phillippe.  Rest now.
What is it, d'Artagnan?  Assassins falling from the sky now?
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
Thank you, your Majesty.
Yes, your Majesty.
Get out of my way.
Sire, I --
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
It's lovely.  It's just...
You would do that, your Majesty?
Sire, I --
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Gotta come from somewhere...
Well read this -
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
No...
Yeah.
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
OK...where do you want to start?
What?
I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
Book code?
How much do you know?
He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
No.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
What?
It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
Are your parking permits in the computer? He drives a van.
It'll do fine.
You'll come by?
No.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Yes.
Absolutely,
When you saw Dr. Lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? And did that help you identify him?
Three, four hours.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
I call him a monster.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
To do what?
Blue, then.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
And... where are things?
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Yes. Is Molly there?
I know... 'Out in the good air...'
Lt. Fisk said...
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
I got it. Thank you.
Yes, I thought so.
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
Then how did you catch me, Will?
You had disadvantages.
You got it.
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis...
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
I'm here, ain't I?
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
It's me.
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
What is this, World War Two...?
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Positive.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
Two grand.
Morpheus believes he is the One.
The Matrix isn't real!
How?
Just get me outta here.
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
You could say that.
This can't be...
Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
Your training.
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
Of the Resistance.
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
That I would find the One.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
Yeah.
Who?
What do you mean, without him?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Most guys do.
Who is?
Why?
What happened?  What did you see?
The Oracle.
Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
That means it's good.
You sure?
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
Anybody wanna have a game?
She don't look Jewish.
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me.  My mother can send me some.  I don't know.
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
Forget it.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
OK.
Get him in.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
We'll be here.
Bye.
Oh...around...why?
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
What do they expect you to say?
"Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
I don't mind.
Did you?
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Sal!... fourteen street.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
That's okay, Daddy.
Oh, the goddam party --
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Honey --!
But what?
What will I tell Annie?
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
Yes sir, Mr. Black, a pleasure.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
I didn't say.
Cold.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
Me, too.
What?!
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
As much as Joe's?
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Over my dead body.
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Yeah.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Mine, too.
You loved back?
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
Hey, this is fun.
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
Confused, huh?  About what?
'Love'?  Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
You love Allison, don't you?
How did you meet?
I'm lost.
Do you love Drew?
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Very well, I'll watch.
And I'll be a visitor.
I mean I appreciate that.
I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
-- I guess you haven't.
Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
And you can't tell me who you are.
It gets worse.
Then don't.
But there's so much to tell you --
It's a saying.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
So you've grasped the idea.  Con- gratulations.  Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Yes, Bill.
How about giving a guy a break?
Yes.
No.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Why didn't you stop me?
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
I wouldn't put it that way.
'Fish'?
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
-- An IRS man.
An offense --
I guess you have your reasons.
'...Yes --'
Then don't.
What?
No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
How's that, Quince?
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
You think Drew will go for it?
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
How did you know?
Drew told me.
I know it's none of my business --
Uh oh --
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
Nothing.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
Nothing lasts.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
What?
No, let's go.
You did.
I don't want your fucking money!
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
What does he want?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
Thanks.
A BEER, please.
What are you here for?
My name's Leonard.							 *
I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
Thank you.
You're in a playful mood.
Mr Gammell?
John Gammell?
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
You're living.
Probably left it in your room.
No! Should I?
What's wrong with this one?
Who's she?
Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
She couldn't.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
What sort of questions?
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
Are you sure?
What's your twenty?
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"...
How many?
25% discount on the load.
Make it 35.
I insist.
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
Cost less.  That's the point.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Maybe I'm only one.
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
Really?
Of course.
I know.  And now?
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
Alonzo...!
"Salutations from the south..."
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
I had to lay eyes on you.
They lied.
Yeah?
Men, they mostly faggots.
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
For money.
You inviting shee-it.
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Twenty bucks...
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
You want me to leave?
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
No sir, I'm no cowboy really, but I'm a first class stud.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
Uh, yessir.
Get lost.
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Two kilos.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Well, it's an interesting place...  Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet.
Yes...?
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
But just...
Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred.
Beats working.
I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
After we're outside the kogus?
Cut his fucking throat.
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
I know where it is.
Yeah? Where?
What is it? . . . Billy?
For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay!
Work, work, work, that's all do
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
You got a better way up?
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
No...
You did!
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
That's camouflage...
That's why we should do it now.
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
What do you want to know?
Thank you.
What are they...?
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
I don't have a title yet.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
Done?
Well, I hope you like it.
Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me.
Then who did?
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
--cliff-hangers--
What?
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
It's almost done. By dawn we'll be able to give Misery back to the world.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
Yes.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Here it is.  Very first copy.
Great.
Well, you've thorough about it, at any rate.
Hugh, I'm impressed..
Oh, I am.  Later..
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
A change of plans?
Sit down.  You'll be a billionaire.  Better than being broke.  I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line.  Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
I knew where it was.
More like two-two point two million.
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
Damn, you're beautiful.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
I'll muddle through.
I wasn't thinking!  Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt, that's all.
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Excuse me?
Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
Nyah still on the property?
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
Do I?
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Take off your God damn coat!
Who is "they?"
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
Ethan?
Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay?  Were you followed?
Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
It's Hunt.  What do you need for a pinpoint?  Been watching a little T.V., have you?
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Information.
What kind?
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Why don't you come back with me?
On what?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I'm not being dropped anywhere without my money.
Bank?
Just waiting for you, tubs.
I didn't touch it.
Higher.
Why?
Oh?  What's the problem?
- and picked us up in the States -
They stamped it, didnt they?  Those damn Gideons.
And a lonely ass.
Try it again.
Its not working.
No, I'm going.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
Why you drinking so much?
Yes.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
Pop, I got news.
What's your news?
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
Maybe.
It's temporary.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
Who is this man? You're engaged!
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Hurry up.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
You don't have to help me.
Fast.
Instantaneous.
Because I have no Luck!
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
But he wants me to come!
What?
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
Come on.
Yeah.
How can you ask me that?
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
And you're not now?
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Yeah, I'll be in.
Hi.
You? No.
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
This is a good suit.
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Where's the ring?
And who's gonna pay for that?
Why not?
Are you drunk?
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Where is she?
It's late.
Of course I want to.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
It's nothing!
Are you sure?
I'll remember that. What do you do?
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Sure.
Good night.
My God, it's a mansion!
It's a house.
Oh. Right.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
Please!
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
All right!  What do you want?
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
Now - go!
'Tis but a scratch.
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
Well, what are you then?
Just keep me covered.
I am an enchanter.
There are some who call me Tim?
A G...g...g...
What?
Yes.
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
I don't know that!
Thursday.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
Is it?
You're not going to do a song while I'm here!
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
I'm ... your son ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Leaving the room.
Yes ...  make sure ...
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
We're coming with you.
No, It's nothing!
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
You've come to rescue me?
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
Shut up.
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
She loved him.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Aye.
I'm flattered you think so.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
It can wait.  Anything else?
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
I am a blank sheet.
Occasionally.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
Aye.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
I was told you were in a fight.
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Yes.  Yes it was.
The question is, do we need her?
Yes, ma'am.
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
No.  I shall be out walking.
And now I am back.
Read it!
I have no idea.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
What is it?
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Maybe he's not dead.
Why don't we take this into my office.
What the hell are you talking about?
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
Then where do we go?!
Drives 'em crazy every time.
Everything.
Yeah.  The Inferno.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
We're actually inside, aren't we?
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Right, then...
Look around...
But I don't understand...
I'm going home Cynthia.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
Howdy to you.
One.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
I told ya.
Wow!
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Was anyone hurt?
May I have your name please?
I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
But, this could be serious.
No...I need to sleep.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
Unh, unh.
No.... I don't...
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
I'm not sure about this.
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
"Then they'd put you in jail."
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
Those men in front, in the car.
Do you know them?!
Keep going. Go around to the back.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
It must be just so pathetic being you. Sure Billy, grab your dog we'll eat in the van.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
Go ahead.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
First Bank ? But how ?
Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
The Brooklyn Bridge.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
Why ?
A dragon.
In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
What ?
When you are ready.
So ?
I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
Fire the whole division.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
He's been expecting you.
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
Yes.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
I'm fine.
Where are we ?
Of course I am. I feel the testosterone coursing through my veins.  Now that I've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Gee, that is a problem.
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I would do it again in a minute.
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
Hi honey.
How about a nice glass of milk?
I'd like to, thanks.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
I'll try.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
What can I do for you?
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
I won't.
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
DON'T!!!
Big deal.
Like what?
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
An adventure?
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
They're great.
But...are you engaged or something?
Committed?
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Something wrong?
Well I'm sort of involved.
You're telling me.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
O.K.
Beidermeyer that's it, what a mad man.
You're such a baby.
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Keep your voice down!
The boss is watching us...
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
Here?
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Soon honey, soon.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
He was allergic to bees.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
I'm very nervous.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Come here, sit down over here.
No.
He likes her.
That's really cool.
I am.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Have you ever tried any?
No.
Are you here to take Shelly back?
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
I think it should be outlawed.
I will I promise.
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
Do you remember her?
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
For their meat.
Do it!
Sure.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Part of being a New Yorker.
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
You like her.
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
The man you love.
Someday she'll thank you.
Major.  Dish.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
Oh, you're more than okay.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
Let me rephrase that...
You win.
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
He won't get mad, huh?
... that this is all my fault?
... unless he has a hump.
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
... Thomas, yeh.
W...
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
A bad combination.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
MICHAEL!!
This is USDA Prime, largely available, beef.  With no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
I hate that music.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
I see.
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
She's going to rest now.
She's fine.
He has that sign with the tree.
Okay.
D.C.
Your brother?
What is a turkey shoot.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
Yes, sir. I need a room
She sure sings nice.
A little. What do you need?
Good night,
Do you carry door handles?
Nashville.
Well, I got to Nashville. That's pretty far.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
Bye.
When I was little, in church.
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Do you like him?
Linnea?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
What...?  0h, yes.
I'll be there.
Money's no object.
Oh?
Mary?
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
Where are you from?
Is that good?
Yes, they were.
What...
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
Ain't love grand.
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
They actually apologized.
Capt'n!
I hear ya. Play.
Rockin'!
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Wayne Gayle.
Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Three.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
They done that too long in my family.
Want me to come?
Hell, you got steady work.
Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
She done moved to Detroit.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
How 'you doing?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Any other family?
You working?
My father's the preacher.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
Go on - you can have one!
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
You got a problem all right.
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
What d'you mean?
What about that girl?
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Don't call them that.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Day work.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
Like a home, for one thing.
What 'you signifyin'?
'Got a good thing, man.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
Okay.
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
Don't be too hard on him.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
I guess I'll rob a bank.
'Musta knocked her up.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Right here.
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
How's the villa's security?
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
What are you talking about?
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
Did you trace it?
What about McCoy?
Prepping your trip.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
Linked?
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
Who got you into this?
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
What are you talkin' about?
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
You haven't got it?
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
I had to limit your options.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
I think you're full of shit.
No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
Put the gun down, Case.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
Oh I know.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Right. 7:30.
I'm late for lab.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
That you would trip on your Barbie heels and I'd get named prom queen?  Did I say that out loud?
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
Have you been to any parties?
What if I say no?
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
Better than I...
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
Really?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
Why do you do that?
Thanks. So do you.
You were attracted to me?
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
What?
I don't know.
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
I know.
If you went away, what would become of me?
Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Experiments?
We've only been living here six weeks now.  I want that room unpacked by tonight.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
No.  Upstairs.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
It was okay.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
Shut up, Grady.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Let me look at your eye...
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
Who?
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
Whoa!
yeah, I had a bad night.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
Fine.
Did she always have nightmares?
That's right.  I don't.
Mom?
Just tonight, please?  I can't handle the nightmare.  Not tonight.  Not after Phillip.
It's an amazing gift.
People are still dying.  After all this time.  Stop running away from it.  Daddy, please...don't make me beg.  You owe me.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Call me Nancy.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
Then maybe you're ready.
I've heard crazier things this week.
Who would know where they were hidden?
A sad choice.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
Me too.
I'm a vegetarian.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Films mainly.
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
No thanks.
Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
Okay.
Let's go in.
Nothing.
She left me.
I don't know either.
I have thought about you.
Eleven.
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
With a goat playing a violin.
Right.
Well...
How do you think I'm doing?
You do?
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
Thank you.  Shall I...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
Nice surprise.
Can I have your autograph?
Anna Scott?
Yes.
Don't even ask.
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Di Caprio.
Yes.  What do you think?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
Ahm... Bernie.
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Ah... yes, enormously.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
No -- did you?
Point taken.
Wouldn't want that...  Okay -- just one more.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Just take my work for it.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Fabulous.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Why?
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Tell us about it...
I-I-I...
Thank you, ma'am...
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
A vote is before the group.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
Like hell we will! We got the muscle standing right here. All we need is a couple gaffin' hooks and some rope.
Now, what would I be trying to say?
She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
It is to me! An' if I hafta bust way outta this place to see it, I will!
With your own two hands?
Scanlon out!
No!
No! I wanna go!
He is!
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, Mister Murphy?
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
Time out!
'Kay, Mac!
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
'Kay...
Okay. How you doing?
Yeah...
I don't have any.
Yes, ma'am...
Bet you ass...
Take you han's offa me!
No way...
Is he one of the loonies?
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck.  Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
Oh, yeah...
Oh, I'm all through talkin'. Now, let's just you an' me trip on down that hall.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
No.
But, Faith--
But Faith--
Hi there...
My picture's up?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
He's safe.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Because I don't have the right name?!
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
What are you doing here?
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
Are you asking me out?
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Yes?
Oh, hello.
No.  He smokes.
How about that guy at the bank?
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
So, what's your point?
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
I don't know, Kate.
You don't have any idea?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
I think he's having an affair.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
Maybe.
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
Oh.  Right.
'Course he does.
I never even got to be single.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
Is he looking at us?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Like a detective.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
...and a fortune teller.
What about Peter?...
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
When you could've found one in America.
No, why?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
He missed me.
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy  on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me.  But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?
Gimme.
He probably gave 'em an argument.
That's right... .
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
What makes him so special?
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little  I better get you home.
Good. So do I.
Oh she's a beauty.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
I am?
How do you like it?
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
I got my whole life to drink.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
Told him what?
What I did to Joey.
Don't tell me don't tell me!
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
Thanks just the same.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Who is he, Pop?
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
But you've got to listen to me.
I'll find you a priest.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
Yeah?
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
I told you lay off.
My ain't we touchy this morning?
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Take it easy now, Terry.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
You want to know somethin'?
Patrick, me lad, I'm ahead of you.
Keep Charley out of this.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Leave her alone, I tell you!
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
That sudden?
...And I thought you loved me.
Maybe so.
She loved the bull ring and the matador.  She danced to their destruction. Now she dances to her own destruction.  Her dance is of skulls.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
I repulse you?  Very well.  It seems you have chosen your own fate. Live with it!  I should say <b>die</b> with it!
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
I know a Glenn.
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac.  You wanted to take her car.
His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
I don't know.
And who watches your back?
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Yeah, why?
And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
Wait.  You not Adele?
Excuse me, Adele?
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
I bet.  How much?
Let's go outside and talk.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
Someone down here?
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
We still talk, though.
You won't do that.
Why not?
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
It would be worth the risk.
He killed a police officer.
Outside Adele's.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
I told you, I'm not going back.
I'll take the shades off.  Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
Looks like tonight.
Hey, Jack?  Bullshit.  I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two.  Forty-two.  You really <u>want</u> to change, it's never too late.
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Oh, yeah, I'm calm.  In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
Islamic.
The <u>ninth</u>?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Like what?
Glenn?
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
What's going on, Glenn?
Nothing.  I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Why's that?
I'm freezing my ass off.
Studs.  Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends.  I was just thinkin' about you.
It's a guy you know.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
I <i>was</i>...
No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
The State Theater?
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
Oh, he's moved out?
You used to like it.
I see that.
I didn't have time.
I told you, he isn't here.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
No, I was.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Sir, I --
Where's that lizard?
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Power dive!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Come on!
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
I can't make it.
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
Hang on.
Don't get smart with me, son.
We're all going away.
I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
Maybe I blocked it out.
Good.
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
Let's go down to the basement.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Right here. Now sit down.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
It opens, too. Look inside.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
I'll never give up.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Are you for real?
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
I can't do that.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
Oh no!
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
Mom!
I'm home now.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
What do you mean?
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
I'm just happy to see you.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
You look exactly the same.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Pretty much so.
How'd you know that?
Oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. They try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  It's no big deal, Chase. I did it when I was young.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
Zowie.
There's a better place...
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
Go later...
What's that on your forehead, pal?
Andy?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
I said, skip it, Michael. It's my treatment.
I'm not going to die.
More than your friend. Family.
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Kids are great.
Continue.
We?
Thank you.
What happens?
I know a good probate lawyer.
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
You didn't look then, the way you look now?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
What?
What can I do?
Something like that.
Do you take risks?
Not unnecessary ones.
Yes.
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
In some situations.
No. I can't really see it.
Why are we going to do that?
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
We won.
Give me the camera, Joe.
Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
Probably since she was born.
Yeah... ?
Any women on board?
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
Helloooo...
We ought to be suing him.
Andy, you don't want this.
Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
No matter how hard I try, I can't lose a file in my computer.
If you feel differently, Bob, you should say so, when you're called to the stand. After all, this isn't a conspiracy.
Lookit. Lookit!
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
'Mean the whispers?
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
They're coming.
An' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
Which means he went toward sunrise.
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Wha'?
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
Just shut up, okay?
Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
For now.
Rain.
There is no "safe."
You mean....
You <u>don't</u> see.
It's more a place where souls are found, Mr. Riddick.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Not if I'm the one.
What, it's broken?
What's so special about him?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
Zira....
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
He's trying to form words.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
It's a fact, Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
Yes, I can do that.
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
To scare off humans?
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
Identify him, then. Speak to him.
Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Listen, listen -- I can speak --
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
But there's the doll, sir.
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Where's Elias come from?
Over here!
Yeah. How 'bout you?
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
What you got there - beers?
You WHAT? Say 'gain.
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
Fuck you Elias.
Knock it off! We got two men need attention here. Police up your extra ammo and frags, don't leave nothing for the dinks. Hoyt, Junior, carry Gardner.
This ain't Taylor. Taylor been shot. This man Chris been resurrected...
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
If you're gonna do it man, 'least do it right.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
Well..
I really don't know.
No thanks?
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.

What's the matter?
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
I don't.
Just who are you, anyway?
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
They know you here--know your name.
Then he's-- 
We'll find out.
You're probably mistaken about that.  Let's get together sand talk it over.  There's always a solution to these problems.  But it must be near the water.  Quite near--  Yes, if you don't mind waiting.
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
Magruder does.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Right, Miss.
I'll have to know a little more than that.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
If I understand what you meant by that.
There must be-- but when I'm with you I can't find it.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
All right. Get him.
You guessed it. The card's phony. I got plenty of 'em. Different names, different jobs. I work out of San Francisco. Go anywhere, do anything. All it takes is the folding.
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
For five hundred, what do I get?
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
I don't think you locked your door.
What do you want?
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Floater?
Let me know when you've identified him
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
No suicide.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
It does.  May I go now? 
He checks too.
She might.
You ought to know why.
You already have the checks, darling.
Of course.
Be nasty.
In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
Good.  Suez was a minefield for both parties.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Of course.
I'll have some of that.
...from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on Suez...
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
And to history.
I called you a taxi.
Too late.  Just my luck.
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
No need to thank me, if you don't want to.  Just pay for these drinks.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
What about the Cromwells?
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
Dad.
Yes, you said.
'Night.
No.
Not yet.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Right here, partner.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
Kid, get outta the way!!
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
What?
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Anytime.
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
Someone else will be going in with you.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
They never are, dear.
Twenty-five percent.
Storage, I think.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
What's that?
Sit... and spin.
New York.
What's your name, lover.
Diet coke.
Uh-huh.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
Where'd you learn to do this?
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
This isn't a date.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
He died a long time ago.
What id we run into someone I know?
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
What if I lose it?
I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
I know.  I'm glad.
It was good.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
I'm here.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Come on, you can tell me.  I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
I bet.  That was our rent!
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Kit!  Where've you been?
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah... I know what you mean.
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
What?
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
You're a silly girl.
Brides often are, I'm told.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
Anybody want a peanut?
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
-- what? --
-- where?
Has it been fifteen minutes?
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
-- murdered by pirates is good --
You want me to read this or not?
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
I swear it will be done.
Stop saying that!
He's already dead.
We're really in a terrible rush.
I must know.
You're sure nobody's following us?
What?
Whoever he is, he's too late --  -- see?  The Cliffs of Insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
Good. Then pour the wine.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
Congratulations.
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
It's not cheating ... It's charity. Bloom, look at me ... look at me! I'm drowning.  Other men sail through life.  Bialystock has struck a reef.  Bloom, I'm going under.  I am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all I can offer is failure.  Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.  Don't send me to jail.  Help!  Help!
What did I do?
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
What???
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
How's this? 
Oh.
Coney Island??
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
What are you doing?  We're trapped. It's either the show or us.  There's no way out.  What can we do, blow up the theatre?
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
Yes.  Amazing isn't it?
Oh, the best one.
Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
By the sacred memory...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Heil you know who!
People can hear you.
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Groovy!
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Very early. Dawn.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
How do you know she didn't make a call?
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Look, if you won't believe me, go ahead. You can help me make beds if you like.  Come on.
That's all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  But...  She didn't fool my mother.
Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
She was seen leaving town in her car. Seen by her very victims, I might add.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
Okay. If you'll come along...
Like what?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
An hour! Or less!
And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?  Thanks.
Yes.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
No.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
Uncommon, too.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
Good night.
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Haven't any.
I don't know what you've been saying.
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Just before she died she came to--
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
I don't know, [I tell you].
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
Oh, nothing. A cou- ple of my patients having a little argument.
What did it say?
Yes.
No!  Good night!
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
What's the rush? There's no first act. They'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
I'm hungry. I'll eat the first child I see. And I've an appointment with young Winton at 8:30.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Oh! So, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
What do you think I am?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Get out of here.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
No, sir. About three months ago.
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
Who'd steal her body?
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Good night, sir.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
Don't mention it.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Rose is madly in love with Daddy...
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
Well, yeah.
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
Well, it's not very plain.
She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
Yeah.
Let me see!
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
It's Yankee whisky to me.
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
Is her husband sick or something?
He didn't lose her, he threw her away.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
I think we both know her.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
She will succeed.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Quarter of twelve.
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever.
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
What did you forget?
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
Well, it has buttons.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Well, it's Billy.
No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Nothing, Rose.
Oh, yeah?
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
I see. Outside it.
She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?
I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home.
You can stop it right now.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
I don't mind.
Incestuous.
Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
I need the "when" and the "where."
She's fine, as if you cared.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Get ready.
Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
We have to find Kittle.
There probably is.
Not like this.  Are you even listening?
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
Going into Zimmermann's pipeline.
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
Slow down.
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
Gimmie a minute.
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
Seatbelts fastened, please.
Keep 'em busy.
They're... around.
Well, let me tell you how it is...
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
I can't see.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
Hold me.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
All right, hang on.
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
Rocky!
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Oh Brad.
Dammit, Janet.
Oh...
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.
I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
I didn't make him for you
Oh no no no no.
No no no no.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...I suppose.
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Do me another favor?
Don't tease me.
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
...What?
...I can't beat him.
Apollo?
Yeah, I can't beat him.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
Christ.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
...Of the truck that run over your face.
No wine.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Do I have to pay juice?
Excuse me.
Did you hear what I said?
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
I like yella teeth.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Yeah, Kayo.
Yeah.
I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
See what?
It ain't your locker no more.
He ain't losin' nothin'.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Whatta these guys want?
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Does it hurt?
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Eddie, come on.
One too many safes dropped on his head?
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
Yeah, that's better.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
A Toon?  Noooo.
Get away from there.
Yeah...
Yeah?
Leave Me!
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Good-morrow, cousin.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Out--
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
Art thou hurt?
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Romeo, come forth.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Well, what was yours?
Here's goodly gear!
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
As my American friend Larry would say: are you fucking deaf?  It's under your seat.
Leaving...
It's been known to happen.
Not yet...
Nobody's saying they don't.
Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
Ready when you are...
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Do you have the material?
Not so fast.  Who's that?
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
I think not.  I have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens.  Unless, of course, I deactivate it before it goes off.
Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Gets the job done.
Who's they?
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
To see a man about a thing.
I can do that.
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
But you can't.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
You would have done that?
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
I don't know...
Something like that.
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
Finish the job...
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
I get the picture.
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
Torch it?!
I don't know.
What are you gonna do?
This isn't a joke. What are we going to do!
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
There it is...now what about the others?
He killed her...
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
None of us like it!
Because someone may have gotten away.
What for?
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
I don't know, Booth.
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Dammit youre persistent.  I dont want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Sort of.
About what?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
What?
Yeah let's hear about your day.
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
Dwayne put the gun down --
So I want the money and I want it now.
I was in the neighborhood.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Not in the trunk.
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
No, I just assumed...
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
This is your ship?
Your friend's ship?  Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
Lee, you okay?
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
Carter, would I lie to you?
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
You.
Who?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
She never even looked at you.
Are you serious?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
No you didn't!
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
What?!?!
It's worth it to me.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
First class.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
Shut up!
I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
Don't push it. You better watch your ass with these Fed types. If there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
Tell me about it.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
I was being polite.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
Let me just clarify a few things.  I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America.  Without me you are just another tourist.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
The license!  You get it?!
Did you make the plate?!
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
That one is my favorite.  Chicken puff with shark fin.
It's him.
You know him?
The Feds?!
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
How much they want?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
No, sir. I'm as good as it gets.
Nobody touches me.
I'm waitin' here for a name.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
You have what I asked for?
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got em.
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
Where do you think she's going?
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
All the gory details.
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Why do YOU think she ran?
Unbelievable, she got to you.
I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
Tootaloo.
That must have made you proud.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
You have one?
Really?
We think so.
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
You can turn that finger around.
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
No.  You take it.
I don't and I don't think you should...
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
What!?
That's called changing your mind.
A little longer for me.
Really?
And the wedding date.  There's the two of us.  So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
Where?
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
Lighten up, what?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
It's for the bell.
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
But it's on the water.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
At the top of the Empire State Building --
Right.
I love you, too.
He said hello.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Come on, Jonah --
Yes.
Mom, we already...
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Magic.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
No.
Why not?
Eighty dollars.
P.  Dad?
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Somewhere in the middle.
I'm starting to notice that.
What?
I know.
Is that what she used to sing?
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
It's a short word.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
No.
It was all they had.
Hi.  Sam?
I say we gotta take action. Now.
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Never... never... never!
I'd lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I'd say to myself, think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I'd think of you. And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
I'm going back tomorrow.
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the funeral.
Will you be still?
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
Forgot what?
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Now that's down-right insulting.
Get used to it.  You're in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
Ouch.
Colette ...
Why not?
I can't leave.
Fuck you.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
How far out of town?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Please open the door, Danny.
You can still work.
Why?
I don't want to leave you.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
I guess there's just no substitute for good genes.
He doesn't have one.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
I don't trust anybody.
Pooh-Bear, I don't mean to be rude, but I get the feeling you aren't taking me seriously.
I'll keep that in mind.
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
Question is, what are you doing here?
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
You think you're so god damned smart, don't you?
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Answer the fucking question!
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Yeah.  What about him?
He's the only one I told.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
Didn't you hear?  Domingo's dead.
With you clowns watching my back? What do you think?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
What is it, drugs?
Better than drugs.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Sir?
Thank you, sir.
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
The Army gave you that?
Shit, that was no big deal.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
Cap'n...?
Nope, he ain't Wade.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
No, three brothers of his were killed in action.  Command wants him out of there.
Sarge?
Some.
I don't expect to live that long.
You don't count.
You tryin' to get yourself killed?
I've got a line on one.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
Good news?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
It doesn't take this.
Bits and pieces.
Oh, yeah?
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
But, sir...
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Ours is not to reason why.
Why's that?
Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
What if our guys open up, sir?
Have it your way, Captain.
Get back to your positions!
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
Races through the debris.  Trailed by BULLETS.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Hey, I got a mother.  Jackson, you got a mother?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
No, no he's not.
Understanding the following rights...
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Going out as friends.
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
See you tomorrow.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Meaning?
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Now why can't I tell the story?
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
You're going.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Yes, I...
They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
Bye.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
That's cool then.
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Mmmm.
Me?  Sure I do.
What did you say?
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.
I'm doing alright.
I don't think so.
No I didn't.
I love you.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
The guy with the Datsun?
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
How do you pay for one of those?
Seriously, Lloyd.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
Yeah, but how come it worked?  I mean like, what are you?
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
You would, though.  That's what I'm saying.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
You're kidding.
I'd say I'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, I don't know.
It's bad business.
True.
These people, my people, I want my people.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
Yes.
Yes.
Do what?
No, we got pressure from California State. The man practically has clemency. We can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. He has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Where is everybody?
Not until youre dead.
You have a right to be angry.
Good for you.
Enter Cotton Weary.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
Not one bit.
She dumped me.
No way.
It's under control.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
I find his work overwrought.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
So we found a compromise.
Tails.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
Billy had alibis too.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
They thought it was a publicity stunt.
I'll give you one guess.
I don't play games.
Stay away from the cop.
I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
But...
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
What's your favorite scary movie?
You are so not funny.
Who is this?
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Did you request this case?
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
What did you know about your mother?
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
Follow me.
Where are you Dewey?
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
Has anyone else every used your phone?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Oh shit it's my cell!
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
There a story in that building?
Gale Weathers would find a way. 
Yeah.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
Huh, fine.
W-what do you want?
No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise.  And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly.
Go there.
Are real?  How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know.
Sorry.
Oh yeah.
She looked dead. Still does.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
It's been a year since she died.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Yeah... I think so.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
I want to talk to you for a second.
Uh-huh.
I only eat popcorn at the movies.
What's your favorite scary movie?
You have to have a favorite.
No.
What do you think I said?
You getting scared?
Guess.
No... please.
Don't do this. I can't...
YES!
NOOOO....
Please go away! Leave us alone!
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
What brings you out to these parts?
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Mind if I join you?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
Sidney's father?
...yeah...
At the airport.
Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling.
Should I be worried?
What were you doing out here?
What about the cellular phone bill?
I'll send you a copy.
Do you still think he's innocent?
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression.
Scary night, isn't it? With the murders and all, it's like right out of a horror movie or something.
And why is that?
LEAVEMEALONE!
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition.
And what would be your motive?
He came to make up.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
I'm not worried.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
He was there, Tatum.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Deal.
I don't know, they just did.
I did. He's full of shit.
For once, Stu, drop it.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
One is gluttony.
Greed.  It was written in blood.
He's not finished.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
Oh, don't worry. You won't...
A woman...
Murderers like you?
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
It's close.
What the fuck is going on?
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
Can we talk about this in private?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
And, if it's a threat.
Punishing.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Let's go.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
The Marquis de Sade and Origins of Sadism.
I'm fine.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
You do your job...
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
I can tell you now, I know... I'm positive I made the right decision.  I'm positive. But, there's never a day that passes that I don't wish I had decided differently.
Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
Huh...? No...no water.
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
How far's the river from here, Mose?
Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
Ethan...I found a man's seen her... knows where little Debbie is!
Scar! Where's he holed in?
You got it with you?
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
Get some sleep...Tomorrow's another day...
Why?
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Good night.
Think she means for us to follow?
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Over there!
What's goin' on?
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
I'll do it myself.
Cherry-red Tears.
So do I, believe me.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Someone from the village.
Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  That we've created ourselves a ghost?  Come on!
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
And the title of this piece?
Ah
Thank you, Ned.
Right you are, governor!
Yes.
Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king.
Sir Robert De Lesseps.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
Good title.
Of course not!
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No, then.
Go on.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
"Is the day so young?"
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
Above Lord Wessex?
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
"Madam!"
I am, Master Shakespeare.
Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
But the plague
Oh but why "alas?"
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Yes, some of it is speakable.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
I have spoken with your father.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
But why me?
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
I don't have time.
He couldn't get his car started.
Is that going to be deep enough?
How much?
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
Oh, that'll come in useful.
You're sure? There's lots more.
Nothing.
I beg your pardon?
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Just one thing.
Well, yes.
Know and love?
You're right.
David?
His car's still there.
Yes.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
David?
The perfect couple, I should say.
I see.
Downstairs.
Who said there were four?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Do you smoke?
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
Were you expecting anyone? Tonight?
In this firm.
I'm a doctor.
The human condition.
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
The first one was fine.
Look again if you like.
Do you think you have a good memory for faces?
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
Chicken salad, Devra!
Don't you like her?
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
Yes, but... I thought...
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
Calm down, baby.
I'm coming, baby --  How's Otis doing, anyway?
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
Why don't you see Lester?
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
I guess so.
Have you ever made it with a girl?
... just, you could look very heavy...
Yeah...
Right.
And you need money?
Pardon me?
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
-- Yeah... your car down here?
Well, I do.
Great.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Did you?
What about it?
Jackie, can we --
We're friends.
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
Why?
That's it, then I'm leaving.
Well then what are you trying to do-
It's too late...
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
I'm busy, man.
I don't know if you don't know --
-- please, please forgive me...
-- took a bus.
That's too bad.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
George, I don't --
Yeah, baby.
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
Great.
When is that?
I'll call you.
What?
Where's your car?
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Jesus.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
I said sit down!
Oh Jesus Christ.
What, do you think I planned it?
I'll have to wash one out.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
What about her?

I'll call you back.
No you won't.
Somebody's mother.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Who were you talking to?
Whatever his name is, that actor.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
Jackie, what're you doing?
That's right.
See you later.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Well, you know what I mean.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
C'mon.
Sure.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
Sort of.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- he'll never know the difference.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Are you married?
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Yes.
French Fries and Ketchup.
I'm not supposed to.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
How does he tell you things?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Is Tony one of your animals?
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
That's right, sir.
A nigger.
A nigger cook.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Thank you for saying so.
Your money's no good here.
It's about eleven thirty.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Stay away...!
Darling, light of my life, I'm not going to hurt you.  You didn't let me finish my sentence.  I said 'I'm not going to hurt you... I'm just going to bash your brains in!'  I'm going to bash them right the fuck in.
Give me the bat.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
I'm intrigued.
Well, it's very... homely.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
Thank you, Susie.
How're you getting on?
Fine.
Well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Rattling. Rustling.
Okay. Have you got enough gas to get home, Marty?
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I don't get you.
Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
What the hell does that matter?
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
It could have been anything, Marty.
Oh?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Well... thank you.
Really?
You know what we're saying!
HE'S SO FINE...
Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
Were you wicked?
Like this place?
Whatever.
Um, I don't really know this one...
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
She won't?  Why not?
What?
This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. You should get to know 'em.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Again?
I see.
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb guy?
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for it to happen!  And I was the one they were shooting at!
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
Out of the question.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
You have a phone call.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
Even nuns have to pee.
A hiding place.
Where's who?
Who are you guys?
We didn't tell you what?
Take care of it.
Which one!
I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
But where?
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
Many have.
I hit him square.
This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
He is dead.  You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut.
They need guidance.
Master Hardenbrook...
But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
Not for lack of trying.
The militia?
Well... so much for common sense.
I manage fine alone.
The Western Woods.
I hear nothing.
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention?
Did your father take a loan?
Lady Van Tassel.
I doubt that's the end.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse.  I'll leave you to your business.
Other people?
Small talk.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
People have put their trust in you.
They have done nothing of the sort.
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
And, what did he say?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out.
I do not know.  Away.
In a way, yes.
Doctor, he is awake.
She is guilty.
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon my language, ma'am.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Can I see him?
Naw, we don't have biscuits.
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done called him. He'll be here.  Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I need you to help me ice down a tub of beer, you and Frank.
It went real good.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
I'll be back in a little bit then.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
I know Albert. We're friends.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.
Did you want to play ball with us?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
How did your mama die?
She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Oh, jackin' off?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
A boy or girl?
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
It was fun, anyhow.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Mama?
I stay on my feet all the time at work. I just can't find shoes that's comfortable.
Yes, I guess you are.
I want to come back and stay here.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Ma'am?
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
I done et just a little bit ago.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
Oh. How about before that?
I know.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
It's mine all right. I've owned that little sucker for a long time.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
You've suckered me before, darling, remember? Why should I believe you now?
I know you think I'm lying to you, but I'm not. Every word I told you is the God's honest truth.
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
Yeah, well, do your thinking somewhere else, Michelangelo. I got work to do.
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Yeah, well, there ain't no baby in there now. You dig? There's nothing in there now.
Huh?
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
You don't have to apologize.  The coast is probably clear now anyway.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
What time did you get to bed last night?
Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah, it might be.
Here, catch.
And started to run.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
No wonder he was angry.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Hid it from my mom.  Caught a mess a sea runs.  Damn thing's still in my closet.
That's obvious.
I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Tried to.  Defaulted on their payments.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
It seems human.  To me.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
He didn't want to lose any more.
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Maybe...?
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
I want you.  To tell the truth.
Maybe.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
<u>You</u> said that.  That was <u>your</u> testimony.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
He had no reason to.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Yes.  And that one, too.
Bye.
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
Get lost, will you?
Manhattans?  This time of night?
No we're not.
But suppose he loses?
But suppose it doesn't?
Hey, Joe!
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
I thought you weren't talking to me.
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
They got the bull-fiddle.
And I'm Daphne.
Tore off one of my chests.
You - you -
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
I'll say there is!
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
Honey - she called me honey.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
And you've got cold feet.
Let me warm them a little.  There - isn't that better?
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
Thank you, Daphne.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
Oh yes, we do!
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Why?
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
Pleased to meet you.
We'll adopt some.
You got to be under twenty-five -
William Morris!
Yes, we're the new girls.
Where did he conduct?
I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
Rough?
Bingo?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Now, really -
Not very likely.
Not at all.
Certainly not.  with all that unrest in the world, I don't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve.
- riding to hounds -
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
It's the crews' night off.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Have I?  I'm trying all the time.
Complete washout.
Talk about sad.
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
What's what?  Oh, that.  just a little going away present.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
We got different information.
Yes, sir.
Goodbye, Charlie.
Except its Scotch.
When I freaked out at the pub?  That was nothing, just nerves. Dont worry about it.
Hey.
Sir, yes, sir!
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldnt split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
I had to say something to get you here.
Theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
Other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
Oh, hello.
Its not supposed to be anything, Kat. Its just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I dont know.  You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
A weekend?
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
What?
But nothing did.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Desperation?
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
You don't live around here, do you?
Sometime, but not like this.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
What do that mean?
Yes, Miss Johnson...
Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!
Here, put my jacket over you.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
He'll show up one day.
Come here, son...
Soon -- but it won't be too much huntin' you'll be doin','cordin' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you'll be goin' away from here, won't you?
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
Goodnight.
David, come back here!
You sure can, son...
Good night, Mama...
Yes, mam...
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Come in, children.
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
If I tell you I didn't, David, that's what I mean.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
I'll walk...
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
Ike, you could make a song outta that!
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
I wanta see Nathan.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Fragile?
Eric!
What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
About what?
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
What Cartman?!
Whoops.
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
The N word?
The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
A hunger strike? For what?
Something big, children.
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
This is the place--
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
Mrph mprph!!
Oh, you want out of hell, huh?
Guess.
Yeah, I guess.
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
We can't leave without you!
Yeah!
What is 'fisting'?
Huh?
No, it was worse than that...
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
You would know, dummy.
So what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge.
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
Check.
And the butfor?
Oh Sara...
Oh, thank you.
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Why, didn't they say?
I can hardly wait.
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
I know, I know.
Damage control!  What kind of damage? What's going on Barnes!
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
This is my second commercial flight.  I used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast.
Just considering our options... sir.
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Great.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Why?  Where are you going?
Except write our wills.
How am I supposed to know?
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
Need some advice, huh.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
What's it look like to you?
I never saw you.
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
What did you do to Buzz?
I want you two to pick up Buzz and bring him to lane six. Junior will take it from there.
He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
A guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling. You got ambition like a...like a...blowtorch. You go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - PSSSHHT! -  shish kebabs.  Maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good.  I think I could help you, Theo.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
You keep that up Carmelita and one day you'll be a champion just like Mr. Skinner here. What do you think, Theo? Think Carmelita's got the stuff?
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
What do you want with my dad?
Business.
Where did your brother escape from?
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
Ha! And what do you have to do for him?
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
I'll be at the bridge.
It?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
You don't get two chances with Junior.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
Sez you!
Lips still for sale?
Tell your little pal to let go.
Get out of there!
What is it?
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
Thirty yards.
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Press?  No, I haven't.
Storm?  What storm?
It doesn't make any sense.
What team?
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional...
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
In the ship, sir.
If the subs aren't here yet, sir --
I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I did.
She wired this system.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
What?  No, I know they're civilians...
We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside!
Resetting the sub.
That's quite a secret.
Wait -- down where?
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up --
Don't do this.
Beth --
Still clear.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
It's a soporific.
Not believing you.
Your watch.
Do you fear them?
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Is it?
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Get away from the door, Beth.
Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's go home.
By the bunks.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
You holding up alright?
I'm not being defensive.
I'm fine.
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
What are they?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
That's right.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
The ships?
Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.
Told me what?
Who's everyone?
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
This is like nursery school.
Why's that?
You seen my suitcase?
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
Anything I want!  Now that's interesting.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
He'll be well cared for.
If you're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman... We're the ones who have been rewarded.
Sir, I have a couple of extra circuits.  Perhaps they might bring something.
Well, ask him.  Tell him we need five thousand.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
I'd consider it an honor.
Well, maybe you better look again.
It's what I deserve.
Sir, no, sir.
Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
I'll take it... until I get killed or you find someone better.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
Oh, I don't know... Depends on who you are spending it with.
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
A funeral.
I have good reflexes.
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Carl can wait.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
I love you.
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
Uh, look, Diz...
You saying you didn't ?
Well, excuse me, sir...
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny...
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Been better, buddy.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Uh, I don't know.
What is it, Rico ?
What's going on, Diz ?
We're not leaving you here, sir !
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien vessel?
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
You are what...?
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
I'm aware of that, sir.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
It's a programmed <U>mechanism</U>, Mr. Spock...
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
I want him here.  Sit down!
The point... 
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
Go you Huskies?
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
The people in New Hampshire.
I quit the movie.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's in your play.
No, no, I see...
And likewise.
I live there.
That's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
...that.
<u>Yes</u>...
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
Better idea...
Why?
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Later on.
Because I'd met someone else.
I used to go out with a politician.
Sure did.
That's right...
It does?
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
...you think that's right...
If I go to jail...?
I'll knit you a sweater.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
I have to tell you something...
That's what they call an events cluster. Some guy, nobby orders a Manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.
Hi.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Sure, what have you got?
How old are you?
You can go...
You mind...?
Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
Cool it, Babe, you started this...
But we...
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
No, no...Please.
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
I'll put the, in your r...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr...
Uh.  Bob Barrenger, fella, <u>Cameraman</u>...
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
My wife's going to have a baby.
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
I can only write on a manual.
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
I...
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
I...
What's in all the bags?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
There's no witnesses...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
She's <u>dying</u> and <u>Rache</u> is your mother now!
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Because it feels really incredibly good.
Like how?
I'll be there for you.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
Oh, yeh.
Don't. Take me with you.
I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
This is my house too!
And this is my room so get out!
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
You think this is funny?
Great.  Big ears, too?
No.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door...  Ben!  Knock it off!  It's gonna go beautifully...  Damn it Ben --
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
What honey?
Is that like Luigi's?
Of course, you do.  Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food.  So, all the more meatballs for you.  But you know what.
Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
Pray.  We never find out.
I have cancer.  Do you know what that is?
Is your bad?
Where Ben?
Ben where do you have to get to?
Half.  Of him.
Have you still never told him?
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
I don't recall inviting you.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
She was angry at herself.
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Don't flatter yourself.
Nobody likes a snoop.
...it's my problem, too.
See, I know that.
You're a cross-dresser.
It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat.
Thanks, but it's under control.
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
It's the same choice you made.
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Is that what he told you?
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
Worked.  Like a charm.
Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
Oh please.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
You're the hip and fresh.
Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
I know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But 'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Rache, get out of th...
What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
What?
Like what?
You know...Stanley...
Great to be here.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
No.
He wasn't.
I am sure.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Well, I changed the ending a little.
You're absolutely right. The focus is on the college admissions process today.
The same.
One in a million recover.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
OK. Stay there. I'll be right back.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
No.
Um, well, yeah.  So are you still acting?
Well, I went to law school, if you can believe that.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Huh. Kids?
It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
Is it loaded?
You know...I like you.
Prnceton.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
What are you going to do, Cooper, throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Used to Filmore, used to.
I guess not Cooper...
Even better.
She's still alive.
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
Excellent...excellent!
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
Yes, of course.
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
So what?
Ceida Pietraszkiewicz.
What kind of trouble?
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
That's right, sir.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
To peace on earth.
Ask away, Major.
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I see.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Peace on earth.
I presume the planes are armed?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
War.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Where'd they get you?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Forget it.
Skip it and jump, damn you!  This flak's so close, I can smell it.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
As soon as I've checked over the route. About five minutes.  All right?
Sure!  Sure, I'm on my way.
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew?  How do we know that?
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
But how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors won't ---  Hey, King....you're not thinking of --- You don't mean you'd --- ???
Sure, King.
Can I have some?
It was pretty bad, huh?
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
Yeah!
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Yes.
A cloud?
Do you wanna go to the van?
You should get upset. Everyone should get upset. When, when Hitler was greasing the Jews, people were saying, "Don't get me upset. Your bumming me out." My duty as a human being is to be pissed off. Jesus Christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. Nothing ever changes, man. Fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of Oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. And then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. It's all so fucking futile.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
And your mom.
He's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. Sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. It's no big deal. Me, him, and Sooze are gonna...
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
You wanna bet he's with a girl?
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
So you can do an album cover?
In the limo!!!
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No, I'm not worried.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
What she doin' in the van, man?
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Sure I am. It's fun.
Alright, Pony!
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
I can come visit?
Yeah, we're just screwing around. Like Mohammed said. Can't take a joke, man? Hey, I hope you got a permit for that, mama!
Oh, you were there?
No, no, whoa!
Yeah.
Wait, I'll get you some air.
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
It's nice here. It's different.
No, not really. Middle-class.
Yes.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
What about me? I don't have a car.
Military marching bands.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
That's what I mean.
I know. It's okay.
Yeah?
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, yeah, it was a great show.  You guys missed it.
Because I'm alienated.
Nobody. Sooze.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Just put it down.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
I'm talking about idealism.
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Nothing.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
No, I don't.
And I fig- and I figured something out.
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Wait, away?
Oh, fuck it, man!
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
Now?
Burnfield. No place like it.
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
It's stupid.
No, she was just sitting there?!
What's that supposed to mean?
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Oh, my god!
About what?
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Cleo!
It's twins!!
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
I personally think of how Conan started as a writer, then became a...
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
She thinks you went to the police.
Y'think?
I know, but that was before.
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
Yeah, hold on.
Ooops, hold on a sec.
Thanks!  That'd be great.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!"
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
Hi, Artie.
Close, but no cigar.
I'm sorry about New Year's. Would you believe me if I said I had to be with a sick friend?
I've been hoping to run into you.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
With a wildly beating heart.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
I just don't.
What happened?
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Whose?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
Nobody asked you to.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
We've missed you too, dear.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Who else ?
Of course it is.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
December twenty-first.
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
Now you're being silly.  We don't need two cars.  We have a car.  And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  An Isotta-Fraschini.  Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis?  All hand-made.  Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
It's those feathers.  They tickle.
Who?
A little.
I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
Cut out that us business.
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
Wanted what?
Good.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
This guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  Where did he come from? Who is he?
Yes, Madame.
Certainly it's important.  It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally.  The idea of having an assistant call me!
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
That moment is now! What good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? Use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. No one.
Yes. Whatever I say.  From now on.
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Let me kiss you.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
But why?
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
Oh, no thanks.
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
Remember? I was trying desperately to get you're attention.
Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
It doesn't seem right.
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Cheap but effective.
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
Zaltar!
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
You're welcome...??
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
But Lana, you could --
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
Who?
I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.
Me neither...
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Oh?
They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Me? How?
That what they call you?
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
What?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
Watch out for them air pockets!
No...I just have a little stop to make.
What about you?
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Turn on the light.
Where's the light switch?
Superman. The boy you left behind.
He can have mine. Anytime.
Embezzled, Mr. Webster.  Stolen from the firm.
We already have a super-tanker.
Don't cry, Bubba.
Where did it come from?
Hostages?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Let's get you inside . . . .
Oh, hi.
I like worrying about you.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Everything on it.
Uh...home...
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
A parka.
I think he said a "curl."
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
Zod.  Zod.
Yes, but will you honor it?
We have not the choice to refuse, have we, if we believe it is a real hydrogen bomb that they have.
What shall we do now?
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
Stuff it.
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
Superman gets mail here?
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
But he's never there.
Something . . . wonderful.
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
There!
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
What?
This wasn't in the plan.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Not...gray.
But otherwise it's swell.
You described the exact contents of my purse.
I just took a shot at it.
Huh?
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Of this...Superman.
Help! I mean  --  I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it  -  There's nothing to worry about. Help! See.
Even that would be an improvement.
I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
Lex is going bye-bye.
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
If you persist, you leave us no choice.
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
He sure as heck does that.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Enjoyed it?
No! You couldn't imagine -
How good it felt -
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
I guess they are a little odd.
It's not bad.
Thirty-five.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Sure.
Where do you hail from?
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Ah, dear simple Otis. Albert explain it to him.
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
You guessed it!  You're always one step ahead of me.  Aren't you Superman?  Yes, right. There was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors. The minute the signal went out --  Zip!  Zip!  Zip!
We'll see how fast I can fly.
How are you?
We're...not together.
Are you still in touch?
I woke to the sound of Zoe's breathing.  It was laboured.  I looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed her, rushed to the kitchen, and splashed water on her face.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
No you don't.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen...
Billy, please.  The children.
Why?
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
And they loved Bear.
You talked about it?
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
You hate it.
I didn't say that.
Away from your crazy Mom.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
And winter?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
No.
Okay.
You hate that.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
You seem very sure about that.
And what was the weather like at this time?
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
Thanks.
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
That's not news, Zoe.
I need money.
I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there soon, and I'll take care of you.  No matter what happens.  I'll take care of you.
Poached salmon.
You've been retained?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
No.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
I am.  Really.  It was awesome.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Okay.
Will the police do anything to her?
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
Oh, are you a spy for the other side?
A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.
Thanks, I see him...
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
I only had a few hours.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Right!
Serious as a deacon...I like it.  I like your style, son!  In a world of old rags and bones, I like it! For instance, take Sidney.
Is it news to you?
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
Everyone knows Manny Davis...  ...except MRS. Manny Davis.
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
How?
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
I don't think so.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
And where was his wife?
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Hello.
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
No.  You think I'm a hero.  I'm no hero.  I'm nice to people where it pays me to be.  I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office.  I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so --  Every dog has his day!  Lock up and leave the key.
Why don't we hear what Susie has to say?
Why should he put on an act?  Your brother has told PRESIDENTS where to go and what to do!
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
If the stores are open -
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
I can't
Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
What chip?
No one must follow your work.
You told me to.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Dyson.
Trust me.
Terminated.
I'm sorry, John.
Alright, it!  We need it!
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I love you, John.  I always have.
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
David, what are you Counsel for the Defence now?  Did you hear the question?
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Let Furtwngler go. Please.
Mine's the Eleventh.
What's in those files?
What's not right?
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
Sure.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
And what happened to Von der Nul?
What?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Yeah, show me, I want to see you do it. Pretend I'm Adolf. You're the maestro, and you have the baton in your right hand, but you give me the salute just the same.
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Fuck that, Helmuth. You want to discuss symbols here?  This guy was a front man. He was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning?  I'm not interested in small fish, I'm after Moby Dick. Come on, Helmuth. Hard facts.
One of your people told me.
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday.
Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
They said I was dogged?
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
Like shit, boss.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
Did you?  Kudos.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Then, you kiss his ass.
I said I was sorry...
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
This can't be real...
He's turning blue!
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
You're the one who started running.
That one did.
It's okay, dad.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
Well... the red bra.
Okay.
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
Then, what good are you?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
Claire.  Pleased to meet you.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
One brother, one sister.
Underwear?
Why would you say that?
How do you know?
Okay... okay.
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  They switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  Pop-gun.
And, they didn't take that watch?
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
It's different every time.
Humor me with specifics.
May I make two suggestions... ?
You mean, I don't like it, he doesn't pay?
Like, this way... sort of...
The key?
Nobody worried about your father.
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
What?
A Mister... Seymour Butts.
Don't ask.
Nothing else?
Uh... Nell Vance...
I did okay.
Why?
No.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
But there's a sad catch to the story.
I'm sorry.  I'm messing up the study.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
Good.
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
She was unhappy.
Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I do.
Just had to be sure.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
I'm sorry.
We all did.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Where do we go?
This is un-fucking professional.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
I wouldn't talk.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
No problem.  If <u>you</u> don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.  I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years.
She didn't write to me, did she.
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Not me, man.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
What?
The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
Same.
Well, those are the breaks.
You just cooking then?
Not embarrassed.
Where you get your bank statements.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
Depends, don' it.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  But she never turned up.  I called the house but only got the answer machine.  When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me.  Or coming <u>straight</u> to see me.  Who knows.  Maybe she just wanted to drive.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Fancy it?
Yeah, I guess you are.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
Where else?
Yeah.
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
What?
Go to him.  Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp --
Are you finished?
Ah.
Yes. Thank you.
Yes, Ann?
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
Hello, Birdy.
We've certainly missed you.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Huh.
That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...
No. I--tell me--
Cash?!
Yeah.
All right.
What is it, Dave?
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
What kind of man *are* you?
Yeah, right.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
How's that?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
I didn't say a word.
You don't have to tell me anything.
Honey...
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
So--
Huh?
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
No thanks, I--
They sent us to tell ya.
Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
What's the combination?
It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
Mind if I have a look?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
That, apparently, is the problem. I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a Curator of Plant Biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Another storage room.
Eats them?
Okay.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
<i>A month.</i>
No, hold back...
He has to be on foot.  He has the world's most recognizable face.  He can't disappear.
Why would we--
But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Shhh!
Yeah, what happened?
Sorry, I'm way behind.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Your Dad?!
Who?
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw.  We got three of his fingers back on.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments.  Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
I'm not hungry.
What do I do?
That's right.  I do, don't I?
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
I've got my Seahaven Bankcard.
Well, I made it through another night.
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
I'll try.
Well, thank you for your help.
You're welcome, Truman.
Sorry. Don't have one.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
Working with?
The developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. We've just slowed the process.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Who sent you?
That's what I'm saying.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
Do you?
They want to discredit you -- for what?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
I'll know soon enough.
Your guess?
I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here.
I think they have that covered.
You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol.
Nice try, Mulder.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
I don't know why I think they went right.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
Yeah...?
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I'm not taking any chances.
I want to know where Scully is.
How?
In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
No, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Agent Novak.  I didn't get a chance to clear him.
I don't need them anymore...
You're the shrink, you tell me.
I can't leave him!
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
He's beautiful...
That hoist, with the winch...
Dr. Kent.
What about the cat?
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
They think you did it.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
I don't know. How can you know a thing like that afterwards. I don't know anything any more.
He was Harry's driver?
I was told there were only two men there.
Sssh. Don't. Don't, please.
Silly looking bunch.
Need we go through it all again?
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
A parrot...Let it go.
How did you know I would be here?
I shall be all right.
Why should he help me like that? The Russians will only make trouble for him.
His.
We're getting you out of here, aren't we?
Of course.
That's what we want to find out.
Well, I'll be saying good night. Good night, Miss.
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
I can't. He disappeared...
This is where he vanished.
Why don't you come in, too - you're a writer... Might interest you.
All right, Calloway. You win.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
What is it, Sergeant?
Listen...
You've got plenty of contacts.
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
I understand...
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
The Roumanian?
Suppose I take...
Funny?
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
I don't think so.
So?
We're ok.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
But he has been there, off course.
You can swim?
Richard?
I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
We swim.
Exactly.
So?
I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror....
Then I won't bring you....
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
You want it to be an event.
Is he a Nazi?
That's stupid. Why would they?
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
You can't.
What do you care?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
And belief follows?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
What about Curtis Zampf?
I agree.
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness.
Explain it so I can.
Get the fuck away from me.
The arguments, anyway.
With the shoes... There was more than one?
A forty-five.
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
You do it on the inside....
From the Rhineland originally.
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid?
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
I've got to get back to the --
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
Mrs. Moebius.
So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now...
No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
Wow, that's uh...great...
Shut up...
Why me?
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
They're not that Jewish.
What?
It can't be true!
What was he like, when he was little?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
How many are, down there?
Six seconds.
... And his friend, Johana...
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
Tea... or whiskey?
I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
No... tell me.
You sure?
You'll try again tomorrow?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
You want to lie down for a while?
Why?
Positive, Sir.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Did you buy the cassettes?  The Wagner, the Berlioz?
It's my apartment.
Louis, we were French!
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
No.  I'm just depressed.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
... Yes?
What's your first move?
It's Esther.
I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Oh. Okay.
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
A stereo type alarm system?
Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
Why not?
It don't look like a leopard to me.
No. I'm serious about this.
I don't know. I want him to lock me up.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
The elderly man I told you about.
Rosita  I have wondered -
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
You're worrying about its killing someone else?
It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 
We're old friends.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
To the eye? Like other men.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
He'd act normally when he was with other people. It would be a man who suffered remorse and even pity when it was all over.
You've thought of all this before. You know it isn't the leopard   Don't you?
Thanks.
No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights 
It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
You think Galbraith found the leopard on the day you went out with the posse.
Clo-Clo?
I thought you might strut this kitten in right in the middle of her act.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his Art!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You dont mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is hes either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But Ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why Im here at such a late hour. I need 20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
My brother hung himself.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. Hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.
What do you suggest?
Yes. Im trying to reach a friend but I cant get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
Croissants. Like that...
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Right... Well, Ill get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. Theres a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. Theres a lot of people back there. Theyre holding a seminar. Traffickings the past, breeding the future...
Italian? The Mafia...?
Were both thinking the same thing, right?
Its up to you whether they walk or not.
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
Have we done business before?
I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.
Why?
I see. How much?
What...?
Jee... Fuck... Youre fucking mad!
No... No...  I swear...
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
The company. We all work for the company.
I dont know. I dont know, man. I dont even know Friedman that well... I...  Man, youve got to get me out of here...
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...
Where is it?
No.
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, thats what they do to their employees, isnt it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives. Thanks for the lift!
Id appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you cant, dont worry about it. Ill call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but Im in a hurry. 
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
My rates...
Should I come back in five minutes?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
Ill be alone.
Leon? No. Im afraid he left.
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
Should I be?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
You-youre wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time Im in London. Thats all.
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
The nineteenth... How come you didnt know?
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr- pubescents.
Huh! Youve been around, eh?
Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Better today than tomorrow.
Come with me...
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
Yes, but...
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Am I... am I dead?
I was so worried -- we've all been looking for you!  The English are everywhere!  O thank you, lord!
The English??
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
Praying.
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
Let them come!  Let them see who's the true king of France!
That's not a lot.
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Not yet.
Yes, it's a miracle.
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Never look behind -- only ahead!
The clothes are not important...
I said, kneel!
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
What do you mean, they won't come?
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
Oh no?  How about this one?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
He never says his name.
Wladek, please.
Just over a year.
What's happened?
Can you help?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
We use what?
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
No. Three hundred and sixty thousand, so it'll be easy.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
You're out, aren't you?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
Hungry.
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised at you. They died with  dignity, that's what good it did. And you know something else?  Now the Poles will rise. We're ready. We'll fight, too. You'll see.
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
Bitch!
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
God forbid!
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
I miss you.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
I'd like to make a swap.
Yes, I thought that.
You don't want to learn.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
A piano?
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
He'll probably fall down.
What do we do?
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
I'm out, Johnny.
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
There's always a depression on.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
Who's got the contract?
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
If we ever get to it.
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
Lonnegan.
Raise 5,000.
But I got a train to make.
Look, I don't have time to fuck around.  There's somebody out there I don't need to see.  You got a fire escape or anything?
Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
He cheats.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
Oh, Jesus.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
You know how they are... sex...
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
And if it isn't?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Tch-tch-tch --  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.  You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
Yes.
Where did you hit her?
Why... in the heart.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
You see how much we have to say.
Yes, she would.
Yes... yes.
That woman!
No.
What do you mean?
He's holding out on you.
Nunheim!
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
Well, thanks.  We'll call you when we need you again.
Tell 'em.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
That's all right.
I trust you.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
want to talk to you about something very important.
Yes...
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this.  Ask the police.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
You got types?
Maybe a drink would help you.
They were kidding you.
That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Sit down!
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
Looks like a hold-up!
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Yes!
Mimi...
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Who fired you?
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
He's not so--
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Yeah.
Maybe I don't need your ideas.  Maybe I can do better on my own.
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
They're not going to--
...I know.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
They're going to kill us!
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
He's not going to leave us.
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
We'll find our way.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Don't you touch it.
Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down.
Shoot them!
Why haven't they killed us!?
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
With what?  Against how many?
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
The...the gold...
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Thanks.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
I don't think we'll go to war.  We shouldn't even be here.  This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict.  It should be decided regionally.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
For real?  A treasure?
Yeah.  So?
What!?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
Oh, no.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
You have to go with us, Wes.
He lived through that?
Correct.  Origin?
What's the matter with you?
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Look,dirt!
Looks like food.
I don't want to lose you.
No!...No!...
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
Who?  Who's leaving?
Incredible!
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
I'll report you.  It's....
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
I don't know.
What have you done, Cut your hand?
No......  She's dead THX........
Look more closely.
I'm only trying to help you.
Save yourself....
Officer Reilly, vice.
Aren't you on suspension?
Hang on.
`Til we get a better lead.
You don't have to talk about it.
Don't touch that.
Unlikely. Probably, cash register or something.
People are dying.
But sir--
Look, it's important.
Don't talk.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
I didn't. But I had to try.
I promised her she'd be safe.
It's our only option.
I know.
Yes.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
So I said to myself, "All right, if he wants to look at them, let him look at them. No harm in that." And then he said, "Say ah." And then I said, "Ah." And that's all I remember ... And when I woke up, I still had my tonsils, but my pocketbook was gone.
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Nice suit.
Um-hum ...
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
Just call me Gaston.
Thank you, Major. 
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Disappointed?
No, thank you.
What time is it?
Gaston!
But it's not enough!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
They're all right, aren't they?
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Lily!
Yes.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
You like that statue?
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Then riding together.
You're conceited--
But attractive--
I'm crazy about you!
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it. 
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Naturally not!
I beg your pardon!
Then why did you do it?
But you saw it here.
An hour, two at most.
Thank you, Rose.
You're certain?
What? You have to get to a boat right away!
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
Bollocks.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
No.
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
You wouldn'ta jumped.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
A whole ten cents?!
Sssshh. Come here.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
This is crazy.
Now it's worse.
Right.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
Never let go.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Goodbye, mother.
That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
I'll join you later.
I can explain--
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Oh--a hundred times--
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
We'll save you a place at our table.
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
<U>Gladly</U>.
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Guess again, copper.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
Want to take it back?
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
You work too fast for me, young man.
Sorry.
But--
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
Good night, idiot!
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
Not a chance.
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
Think again--
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Sure.
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
I can see you're no gentleman--
Just what the doctor ordered.
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
What do you mean?
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
What's the matter, Mary?
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
What's he got that I haven't got?
Get that out of your trunk.
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
You can't bluff me any more.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
I'll explain later--
If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
Ain't got time.
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
You whore!  You filthy whore!
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too.  Even stole a Horse once.  But you can't--
Easy, Johnny.  Now ain't the time.  I tell you, boys, even I'm Worried what'll happen once Ringo Runs this outfit!  God have mercy!
No...
And you must be Ringo.  Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo.  The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say.  What do you Think, darling?  Should I hate him?
Enough?  Never.
But who was the Devil?
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
I know what it means.
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
Forget it, Ringo.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
I'm on my way.
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
...Words to live by?
My guards are from South Africa, Mr. Bond. This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great' Britain.  Now both of you. Put your hands on your heads, and step forward.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Political considerations?
Not from forty feet.
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
He tied one on.
Three. You? Married?
Have we met?
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Next time, I do the driving.
I didn't say when I want to die -
Sabotage?
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
No.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The Queen invited you to dinner -
Seems to be back to normal, sir.
Start the grinders.
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
Thank you sir! Thank you!
Abort the cruise.
What is a sip of coffee going to do?
How old are you?
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
Harry is coming to pick me up.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
We are going where the action is. Ain't that right, Okra?  Let's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up.  What would you give to be rich?
I'm not here to argue, sir.
Go back to sleep.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You must have been really sick.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Speaking of tappy heads, we ought to have an old fashion fish fry.
Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Okay.
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Right here in the van.
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
No.
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
We're not aiming for the truck!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Miss.  G-6.
I dunno.
She's sick!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Oh, I don't like confrontations.
He got it, Woody!
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
Speed up!
I like plaits.
Is that all?
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
Can you move over a wee bit?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Nothing is left but us.
Juliet who?
I don't know what you mean.
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
I was just waiting for the right time.
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
That's frustrating.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
I don't know.
What do you think?
What's up?
You can't make me.
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
You want to make a wager on this?
Not Tiger Woods.
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
I don't know, sir.
You will dine with me from now on.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
The police won't find your car.
What is the name of your informant?
If I can.
When he loves me like a father, he will never tell anyone he was here. He will freely give the names of his superiors.  Then we get them and they too will give us names.  And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through.  I'm surprised she hasn't called.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now.  Are you all right?
What kind of research?
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Where's that?
What?
What?
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Is that a promise, then?
Unless you get caught.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
Oh, really?
Of course, the motto, the motto --
Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?
People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget - Spud is shooting up for the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.
The only drawback, or at least the principal drawback, is that you have to endure all manner of cunts telling you that -
Running time?
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
You know.
God, you're sick.
You're a real mate. And what about Tommy? Have you been to see him yet?
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
It was my fucking television.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
No, I don't think so.
Such as?
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
With a starship!
Then I shall make use of this starship.
Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
Sulu! Look! The sun's come out! It's a miracle!
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
Join my quest.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
If we could send a distress signal...
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
I ordered you to defend this ship.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
There, you see? See?
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
Fire the rockets!
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
No conditions.
Spock...


"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
Maybe you could wait until I'm a wee bit stronger I don't think I could take it in my present condition.  Or yours.
I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
I hide no pain.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
Sybok, we must find a way...
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Flynn had Group 7 access.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
Ok
Right on the money!
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
Where did you hear that name?
Yes.
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
Almost... I just have to adjust our course at the next junction. I'd better go check the instruments ...
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
We have to.
How?
Simon?  Ohmygod.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Yeah, Dad.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
No way.  Not Dana.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Yeah, right.
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
Son of a bitch!
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
I don't know.  I guess... I wanted to see what would happen.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
They must've just missed me.
Well, maybe a little.
Do you still love your husband?
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
No.  But I wanted to.
Dance?
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
Those idiots.
I always have a couple on the hook.  You know.  There's one right now, I've got her panting like a dog.  It's great.
Red hot.  Her thighs steam.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
He said he was an American agent.
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
So now it's Tasker?  Not Renquist?
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
Hello, Alabama.
Get it.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
I'd love some pie.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
She OD'd, didn't she?
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
Uh-huh.
A real live pimp?
Thank you.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
Write down Drexl's address.
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
No thanks.
No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.  You got yours?
No shit? Dick, that's great!
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
No problems on both counts.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
I'm your son.
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Nope.
I got some money I can give you -
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
That was a good fuckin' movie.
You're no longer an extra -
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
Uh, I didn't hear the...
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
What's she doing?
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
You don't have a driver's license, James?  Or a Social Security card?
A jail?  Prison?
This is April, right?
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
I have to do this, James.  You're very confused.
What?
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
See -- you can drive after all!
I thought I was in...prison again.
...I had a dream about...something like that.
No superiors!  No scientists.  No people from the future.  It's just a Carpet Cleaning Company.  They have voice mail -- you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
No!  Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
Negative for drugs.  But he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs.  No drugs.  You believe that?
What?  What did you say?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Christ no!
I won't hold my breath.
Hundred and eight already.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yep.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
Listen, man.  I got rolled half and hour ago for everything I had.
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
I want my car.
Yeah, give me the Miller.
Yeah, I'll try.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
Wrong number.
Do you have to call me that?
May I carry your package, Grace?
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
What happens if you lose?
I guess it must.
What?
Games?
You love him?
No.
You just walk away.
Yeah.
Lied?  What do you mean?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Don't yell at me!  I know it's here! I know it!
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
You heard me.  Count it out.
You could give me the gun.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
What for?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
Grace, tell him.
You've got to be--
John Stewart.
How do you know if you've never tried?
I had a problem getting my car back.
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
About what you said this morning.
You meant it.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
How much could you get?
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
The time wasn't right.
No.
Trouble with the car again?
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money.
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
For what?
But you was going to fight for me.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
The old lady?
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
No police!
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
That a fact?
Or maybe you just think you do. Just another small town. One guy chasing you. You go big town. Just gonna have four guys after you instead. Kiss kissy kiss. It gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? Cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
Who's cursed?
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Oh, shit!
Give it to me!
Who the hell are you?
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
You've got to be--
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
I do.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
He's up at the Look Out.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
Nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
You believe that?
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
I want my car.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Is it pretty?
I could if I had Jake's money.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Can you make it back up?
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
'Cause I love you.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
How much?
What kind?
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
Wow.
Do you remember me getting sick?
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Oh.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
I'll help you.
All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Asked what they looked like, that's all. Christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
That big guy lookin' for me?
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
Yeah. See?
Hell, yeah. A bunch of us Bar T boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. We come across this fucker on a roan goin' South an'...
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
I could run off them whores.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
What?
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
A sign on him?
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Sorry, Ned. Guess I wasted your time. See ya, Kid!
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
Yeah.
I can't see 'em.
Just SHOOT!
Lemmee see it.
Sure. Sure, Bill.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
You sure you ain't armed?
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
It ain't nothin', don't fret it.  She don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
No. I mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? You know?
Beats the hell out of me.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
How far kin you see?
Last night I said I missed my fuckin' wife... tonight I just miss my fuckin' bed.
I know it's rainin',  Give the Kid a drink, why dontcha?
Worms was comin' out.
Best we move that pig.
Three.
No... I meant...
Yeah.
How many you killed, Kid?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
Just like that?
Hell, yeah.
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Who ?
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
They ruined me tonight.
A glass of water would be nice.
We all go. How about it, Keaton?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
Mr. Soze will be most -
Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
I shivved him.
What?
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
He didn't have my lawyer.
What call?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
NO.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
What is the truth?
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
Yes.
When she...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
Yes.
...We did everything we could...
Tell us.
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
Do you, indeed.  I'll bet you do. Fine.  Fine.  We'll save the court the time.  We will admit the Doctor as an `expert witness,' fine.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
It's a crime.
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
... that's all right.
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I...um...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
No, you did fine.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
The most respected ...
... the case with anyone.  And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony ...
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Defense...?
What?
I believe that's the law...is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
From the magazine?
Pardon?
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
Still looking.
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
You, you don't under...
What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.
I have to talk to you.
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
What?
Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
You got a good memory, Franky.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
We got to talk.
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
Yes.
You live in the neighborhood?
How old is he?
Yes.
I used to be a nurse.
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
Yes.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Yes, that's correct.
As I've said we had some more...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Yes.
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Me, too.
And you like it.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Someone dead.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
There are things you didn't tell me.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
What for? Who are you?
What about?
Your name. And --
Judy Barton.
Don't go.
But why?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Ah, no!
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
That's what I had in mind.
Oh, yeah. There.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
Where had you been before?
No.
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
My name is John Ferguson.
Some people prefer it.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
What else?
There's a name on the gravestone.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
Let me go.
Please let me go.
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
I know. Everybody tells me.
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
Could be.
How?
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
For what?
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Did you need it?
Oh?
Oh... this and that.
What I've been doing?
Naturally.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted. 
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
What are you fucking talking about?
Have you ever done this before?
We've already done this.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
You got us into this mess.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
It has worked.
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
What do you mean? It's it's a Goddamn Mini-Mart?!
They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin...
I won't do it.
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Where's the bathroom?
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
Where is she?
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Who?
Left side.
We need padded chairs.
What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane.
He is not cracking up.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Fine? Fine what?
Whatever you say Kojak.
Not a prayer.
Oh really? Starbucks?
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
They need leadership.
Government cutbacks.
I think so.
The wedding cake check?
Don't you dare.
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
How much?
Kiss me...?
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
What kind of seats can we have?
I need your help.
Not yet.
No. Just like an hour or so.
No it's not okay. It's not.
What?
You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone?
But...
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on.
I think so.
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
I have no idea.
Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim...
Where?
Okay great. What will that be?
That's right.
Then it's a respectable house.
Enedina and Paco ...
That one.
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
Come down.
Yes, it is.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
Maybe ...
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
That doesn't matter; I like it.
Why the bad temper?
Don't be a fool! Why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
Why did he kill himself?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
You won't get much done with those people. Those times are over! You ought to let me kick them out.
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Is she coming back?
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Yes!
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
I've had a gutful of this.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
From the terrace.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
Why wasn't I told?
Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
What about them?
Do me a favor  keep sending them.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary reassignment.
Only because I got pulled out early.
It's already been called off. Witnesses confirmed you weren't the shooter.  Did you find out where the bomb is?
I haven't been working on anything.
Do I get to see it or not?
How do you kill it?
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was you, wasn't it?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
Then why don't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while?
I'm doing the best I can!
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
Let's just say I'm sending a very clear message to his ReElection Rally...
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
It's the White House.
Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of <u>paper</u>...
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
Izzat the thing...
...where?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
And you?
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
The American "people"?
...that's the general idea.
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
In the yellow ribbon.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
Anything at the Airport?
...got to be <u>something</u>.  She gives him the sacred...  And tells him:  this is the Traditional Harvest Offering, given to the Man who Ties the First Sheaf, the last sheaf, whatever the fuck it is...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Due in Nashville.
We're gonna do the <u>Team Song</u>.
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
...how ya feeling, boy?
Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
I'm interested in the Security of My Country, Mr. Brean.
Why do people go to war?
...Good...
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
Party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.
What do you think would hold it off?
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too!
Why not?
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
"The Country Is At War." 
"Freedom."
I saw it on TV.
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Leav't alone.  Wha'd television ever do to you?  Ate your <u>life</u>, ruin'd your <u>Culture</u>, but...
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
No.  You're right.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
No, the deal <u>isn't</u> changed.  The Deal <u>isn't</u> changed. You can't ... what is it?  Money?  <u>Money</u>?  You want Money?
Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
No problem.  Here's the...
And one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...
I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
Speak English will ya.
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it?
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
I met them before you were born.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
So you're hot on this stock?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
What? How do you know about my father?
Yes...
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place.
If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Thank you
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
Sell my soul?
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
I started seeing things.
No.  But once I heard...
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
Because he was worried about me.
Pretty.  She's a blond.
You were in an accident?
That can't feel good.
Toward the end.  You remember?
This really isn't a good time.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
This fence...it's so...
I'm sorry.  It's for the flowers.  Why don't you...
You do?
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
Good.  I'm good.
It's niiice.
Jody, no...
Telling you...
In the window.  Norman's at work.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Relieved?
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
Three weeks.
You know what I mean.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
You know what that does to me.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
What?  No.  No.
What am I looking at?
I never said...
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Yep.
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
...I'm positive this time...
It's Madison Fra--
Wouldn't go that far.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
That's not what I'm sayi--
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
It's alright.
She's gone.
What?
Don't think so.
But why would they do that...?
Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
And this - if you decide to take the rest.
Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
'He'...?
Stop it!
ENOUGH!!!
The door, Michael.  find the key...
uh - then he - be just -
He's herniating!  Forget OR.  He's dead batore he's oft the elevator Get me a trephine tray -  Anesthesia - stat!  We need him intubated and blow down!
There are things you will not tell him.
To love, you must be able to feel.
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Leave me alone!
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
- we made a fire.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
All the time?
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
I'm a dentist
I don't know...
I have something I have to show you...
Then make it stop...
Out - I may be some time
I think he's fine - I don't know why you have this thing about men - it would be nice to have a guy in the house for a change - I don't think he would hurt a fly.
I'm your landlady
No worries
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
Yes - of course.
Yes...?
She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
And some really fast cars.
I'd feel like staying up all night! Forever! Or at least till I got the LAY of the land, SO TO SPEAK.
I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
Next time, make sure you put a barf bag in the centerfold.
Let me get this straight...
He kicked major ass and you know it.
From your lips, to God's ears.
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
You know...take the pictures?
I'm getting so good at this.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
We're grateful, Ted. It's not that. Those Craftsman tools...they're a dream come true.
Watch your tone, mister.
Got it.
It's your car. These are all your cars.
Look, the girls of Xenia are gorgeous, you'll see. Next month we'll be back to normal.
I miss them, too.
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
You're a peach.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
In what sense?
I'm trying to help.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
You never know around here.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
He didn't. He had it built.
Whatever.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
It's okay, Mom.  Trust me.
What is all this? When are you coming home?
I'll make you very proud.
Oh. Goodness.
Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
I never figured you for a pimp.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
Me? The King of Coitus?
I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
What about the blood?
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
You have someplace to be?
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
Why is that?
Yeah.
I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
Lombardo ever come out here?
Yeah, but...
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
You're out of your mind.
No you don't.
Do it to ourselves?
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
That's right.
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
What about the explosive?
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
You really enjoy yourself, don't you?
I adjusted it.
You most certainly do.
Would that include me?
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
No, sir... just a businessman.
Dr. Loveless?
Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader?
In an hour they're gone!
You're not going to use it, are you?
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
I hate this.
Watch it!
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
I changed her already!
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
Just do it!
Who'd you see?
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Just us.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops.  I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Can I have something to drink?
How long?
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
A real fireball.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
That's more like it.  Where are you at, anyway?
Yes, thank you very much.
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
You'll be hist...
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Oh --
Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Toto, too.
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Well, you're perfect now.
I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
Oh --
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
Not nobody, not nohow!
Ohhh!
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Did you just hear what I just heard?
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Fine.  He's got a plan
Yeah. Me?
Not nohow!
I want to see you and your wife right away....
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
Heres your imposter. Hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  Theyre not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.
Alright then, brunch.
Its part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Elektra King.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
I could come for a second opinion?
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. Hes a man of great integrity.
Shes not a girl anymore.
The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
Partially, yes.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
Youre not going to.
I dont want to be safe!
Shush.
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
You are out of your league.  Shes working with Renard.
A rope!
No!  Get me out!
How appropriate.
Id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
Is it?
How would you know?
Washington?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Wrong answers?
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
Jon, no -- I can't --
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
Cured, yes.
Jon -- what??
Veidts complex.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
And what if youre wrong?
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Play one.  Educate yourself.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
They're practically on us . . .
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
What do you mean, frame-up?
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I don't know their real names.
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
What is this place?
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type.
Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Let me.
I thought that was in detail.
Alright, so I'll get more.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
What's the deal?
Been to any good diners lately?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
Sure you are, sport.
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
Deal.
To find Rogue.
I'll go.
What did she do to me?
It was Xavier's people.  They knew.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
What do you want with him?
What do you mean to do?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO?
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
Is it that music?
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
Yes, don't worry.
I promise.
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
Will there be anything else?
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Why did you do that?
Break that old man's violin.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
But, sir...
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
I see.
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
No.
Go ahead, play dumb!  You'll lose your sockers and then be fockers.
What?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
How?
It's always been one of my favorite names.
Thank you, Master.
Soo -- pah doo -- per.
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Are you serious??
Good!  It shouldn't take more than a few seconds.
Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
I've missed you intellectually, too, Doctor.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, I will.
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Do Something!  Stall them!
I'm sorry, sir.  We only seat by reservation.
Now just one moment.  There's no need for roughhousing.  Have you ever tried a tip?
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
I'm explaining my reasons.
But will they make good use of them?
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
