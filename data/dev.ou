Forget it.
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
Tons
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
What good stuff?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
He was, like, a total babe
Why didn't you tell me?
I guess I'll never know, will I?
It's just you.
Perm?
It's just a party. Daddy.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
It's her favorite band.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Are you lost?
William would never have gone to a state school.
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
I told you
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
What are you doing here?
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Acting the way we do.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
For. . . ?
It's just something I had.  You know
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
I didn't care about the money.
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Because I like to torture you.
Parts of it.
Which parts?
Just smack her now.
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
Kat a fan, too?
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Dr. Ruth?
But -- who -- what --?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Excellency, you are right.
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
You don't usually ask.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
Appointment to what?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
Then you are too ambitious.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Chief says -- he has a God.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
We're lost!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
But it's...
Yes, I considered it.
What about back home?
What are you asking me?
They're not gonna send you right back.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
I let her take a shower.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Is that all there is?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Alright.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
You're not so bad yourself.
I love you.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Keep them out of my way.
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Two weeks holiday.
I have five-hundred dollars.
How long are you planning to stay?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Okay.
I want to document my trip to America.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
Ha. Ha.
It's easy to learn.
We started over, you can too.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
I want to hear everything he said.
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
She's in the bathroom.
Thank you, Daddy.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
How is gregor?
That's right.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
I understand.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
Opening pod bay doors.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Here's hoping, baby...
Would you guys...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
I got a lot to protect.
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
You just drove by it.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
Yeah.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
One of  em's in the slam.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You sure you want me to?
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Jack, wait...
Hi, it's me...
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
That's no bull.
What do you want?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
When?
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
First, the money.
Don't mess with me. How much?
Try and take it.
At your service.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
Good luck..
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Uh... at least fifty.
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
So, just how big was this fare?
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
...Ma???
Thanks for reminding me..
Crystal.
Yeah, very big, a giant.
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
I've had enough good news for today
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
All 900.
I told you not to read all that crap!
...The rain falls...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Why?... Why would you need me?
Have you identified it?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
No... not at all.  Where are you?
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
I love you.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Right here.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
I figured you share information.
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
I don't know...
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Tell me what happened.
Don't think I won't.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
That's right.
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Pardon me?
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
Thank you.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
Neil... Neil Cole.
I had to ask.  I apologize.
Of course.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
You could do worse.
What?
That obvious, huh?
I know.  Uh...Alice.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Let me talk to you.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
You don't get it, he's after me...
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
No.  Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since...all that.  I'm scared.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
But I've seen her grave.
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
I don't know.
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
Huh?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
Skipper!  Look at the depth gauge!
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
Listen!  Hear that?
Somewhere down there?
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
What????
That's what I said!
We can <u>ram</u> him!
It's the screws, Skipper.  At our declination angle, running in reverse, they're pulling the Shark <u>and</u> Cyclops right to the bottom.
And we're at safe maximum depth already....  Stop engines!
Tell me something:  Why can <u>I</u> hear you, when the others couldn't?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
Mmm.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
What happened?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems. 
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
Yeah.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Was it funny?
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Yes.
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Oh.
Huh?
I'm not saying that.
Fuck you.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
Maybe.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
I know who it is.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
You've been married twice --
How?
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Is there something wrong with the phone?
I don't know you. My goddamn father and I don't know you.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
Who?
No shit.
Well, it was an accident.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Want to know what I think happened?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Not particularly.
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
That's what you think.
Jim... for godsake!
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
I'm doing what I can.
Okay. Also, I want you to put our bases in Turkey on alert, and have the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
Why?
My loyalty was never to my country.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Stand by.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
My husband is a very courageous man.
How can you? I mean they're people.
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
No. I thought about this, Mr.
We're under attack.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
You don't understand. This is an emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
That's my job.
They better. Fuel's almost gone.
Felt like a large asteroid.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
If that's the way you want it.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted!
Ted, there's no time to explain.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
No, I've been excited before.
Don't be too long.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
What?
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Thank you. Cream?
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
Good-bye, darling.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Of course.
The cockpit? What is it?
Would you go up, please?
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
Yes.
Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
How the hell do you know that?
Did you talk to him?
But I-- .
Through his ass.  Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes.
You are married?
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Stay out of this, Matthew.  Tell me where the drug has been taken or I will crush your lungs against this wall.
Harcourt is dead.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
For you, anything.
Ss'kya'ta'.
Yeah, I heard of it.
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
That's the way these people are. You don't hit both pumps you just piss them off.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
I'm afraid so.  The crash did too much damage.  The overload is inevitable, at this point.
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
Dead on all channels.
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
No.  Have you?
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Uh, what's next?
No.. I've slept enough.
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
His Grace is very angry with you.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
The marriage!
I'll be right back.
I'm so relieved.
Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore.
Hardly.
Yes!
Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Yes.
He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa.
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
It's killing me.
Really?
I see.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price.
Why you?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He asked me to stay.
Money! Money!
When, may I ask?
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
Yes. He is a little strange.
It's just a trifle, of course.
Ah-ha!
I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
Well. There it is.
Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
Really?
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
I think so, Sire, yes.
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Would you tell me why?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Yes, what about him?
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
Don't you have a maid?
They say you're in debt.
Yes.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Papa!
Sublime! Utterly sublime!
I liked the horse.
This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
Really?
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do?
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
Who are you?
You mean she's not coming back?
No! No, it's him!
The man. He's here.
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Exactly.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Because His Majesty wishes it.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Baron!
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
So?
And do they believe it?
I poisoned his life.
But not his body.
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
He's setting that play to music?
I've seen the manuscript.
Did we?
Yes, I am looking after him.
What exactly did he call out?
Come to my office, Miss Price.
Tea would be nice.
It was a wolf.
What?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
Sorry.
I'm twenty-seven.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Bathroom.
I was awake and he was in my room.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
A doper werewolf.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
What?
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
You did, did you?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
You're not having a good time are you?
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
Nice to see you.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
Beware the moon?
A coyote.
It's circling us.
Walk away, Jack.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
Shut up, you zombie!
Will you be quiet?!
Nurse!
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
Yes.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
I will not accept this! Now go away!
You look awful.
What about the zoo?
How shall I do it?
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
We'll find him, not to worry.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
How much?
Yeah.
I remember once when your account checked.
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
You don't have to do nothing.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
If I thought you were the slightest bit interested, I would.
Now let me see, what comes next?  Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
Oh, yeah?
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Oooh! That has the earmarks!
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Where is he now?
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Looks good. How much did it cost?
Sure, I think it's swell.
There you are.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
Matt, come here!
Yes.
A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
Yeah.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
Huh?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
The Army can hang him.
What is wrong with you?
You're forgetting who's in charge --
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock.
Ho-yah!
I'd appreciate that.
I had you covered.  From back there.
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Maybe, maybe...
We're gonna have to talk...
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
What?
If you don't see it, it's not real...
Mmm.
I guess so.
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
I think so.
Not at all.
They had to be dealt with!
We did.
What is going on here, man?
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
On a lot of lithium?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Courtney? Dinner?
Dorsia's nice.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... 
I'm ignoring you.
What do you want, Courtney?
Why?
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Maybe.
Yes?
Really?
It's not that nice.
We should do it.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
Yes, I am.
I'm just leaving.
Uh huh.
Patrick?
Calm down. Let's do it anyway
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
I'll do it.
Thanks, Patrick.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Patrick? Is that you?
You're at Paul Owen s.
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Where did you go to school?
Who do you ask?
Do you feel that way?
No. Not really.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
Not really.
We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's.
Marcus?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
I checked it out. It's clean.
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and   - you.
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
I'm hungry
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
Didn't you visit the campus?
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
I can't just walk away!
Guilt?
If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
...Different?
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Not like him, is it? To do a thing like that without telling you. You're not losing your hold on him, are you?
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Gimme the coordinates?
Outpost doesn't own em.
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
That's what I told her. My wife.
Were the flags for Teddy?
I'm okay. It's going well!
Sure.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
No. Please.
Why's that?
Time-Warner has a 40 per cent stake in Gary's set-top device. That also takes out CNN.  "GE joins Outpost in new venture," which means NBC is out. "Disney joins Outpost," ABC is out. "Outpost and Newscorp in new deal," Fox is out. Any of these places could have a mole. Or all of 'em.  It's like a a continuous loop. We can go to some alternative press place that 1,000 people read, get them and us killed. But anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something Gary's got a finger in!
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Please don't go.
Hey, we got seed money for the startup! A million-five!
What?!
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
Yes.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Thank you.
Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
Be careful.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
You must admit, she is rather mannish. No offense, but if that's a woman, it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick.
Thanks.
Austin, I have something for you as well.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Yes, I am programmed to answer any question.
A Chigro?
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Likewise.
Don't worry!
It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir.
My son?
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
You don't say. How real does it feel?
There are limits?
Black...
... death ...
... love...
You mean you don't recall??
He tried to warn us ...
You killed my husband.
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Much better.
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
Small talk.  Try the weather.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Did he say who?
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Thanks ...  I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello?
Barely.
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
The plot.  Hello, we must be going ...
Not quite.
Pity your mother came, too ...
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
You.
Mother and Father know best.
Both, actually.
If you say so.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
No.
I'm very happy for you two.
Shit!
Mr. Thomerson.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Fine. How's everything going?
Thank you, sir.
I've tried to change her mind.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Um... that's very relaxing.
You know your father enjoys his company.
I think I screwed that one once.
Your whores never showed up.
Screw you!
I want women.
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
Right.
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Ha, ha, ha.
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
It's all right...  So have I.
My gift to you.
Who's your friend?
I'll stop him... You stall him.
What's with her costume?
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
He's alive.
-- What he would do to your dad's department? You gotta let me finish it --
Who asked you?
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
This?
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
Fuck you.
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Oooh, very sophisticated. Having fun?
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
How's it going?
Got anything to drink in there?
I wanted to be a good one.
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
What?
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
The outlets.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
-- Go to the bottom. Under heat properties.
Ever burned magnesium? It's so hot it takes water molecules and BAMM!
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Absolutely.
And the world -- the whole world.
Are the glory boys actually showing interest in Investigation's work? I may have a stroke.
I might.
I need to get in the trunk.
Alderman.
Don't you have any leads at all?
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
Why?
Nah...
I was gonna bring it back myself.
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
Are you sure?
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
Did he gots to be.
That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
If you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours.  What's his name again?
Yeah, him.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
Meaning?
I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
No costume.  No blackface.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
Calm down, please.
How did you end up here?
How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy?
Where do you go from here?
In life?  I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers?  The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless?
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
He did the best way he knew how, Junebug is stubborn just like you.
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
This is Cheeba.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
What do you want me to say?
C'mon.  You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family.  You gave your brother a shot.  That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot.  He got his.
For what?
Thanks.
How so?
I don't want to hear it.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
I've always liked the format of Rowan and Martin's "LAUGH-IN."
You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
I don't believe it.
It looks delicious.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
Yes he did.
You know how your Daddy is.
Finland.
What's a Negro.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Oh, because on our first date, she let me...
Around...
You slept too near where you got in?
Just a little something' somethin'.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
O'Grady.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
All Europe shall hear of this!
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
For whom else have you worked?
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
Have you had one?
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
And he doesn't care about me?
Who?
I'm -- I'm sorry...
What do we do?
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
We found him like this! Kendall was with me the whole -- Listen to me!
But not Pike's.
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
The creek bed --
Yeah.
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Why?
Yeah...
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
But not the only victim, right?
Stop.
I don't know --
Maybe he...
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Who killed Pike?
What about the confession?
What the hell are you talking about --
That's horseshit and you know it.
The Senator...
West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
I'm not even going to dignify that --
You and the Colonel go back.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Is Dunbar cute?
You made me look like an idiot --
Got it.
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
No.
Seven.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead -- the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.
We've been making progress, I see.
Then do it.
A pleasure.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Eighteen.
I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Go.
Lucky girl.
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
How I go.
You say...
They're your favorite flower.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
Did you?
You're not.
I need you on my side.
Yes?
Ch...
Right.
And...
You're asking for my documents?
You can stay tonight.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Yes.
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
I do. I want to very badly.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
I don't hate you.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Sometimes.
Some... What does that mean?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You didn't mind too much.
Have you had any before?
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Goodbye.
It's not mine either.
Then start taking them seriously.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Don't make it less true.
Come on, just a little somethin'. Right here. Go'on now, don't be shy.
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
Well, that makes it easier.
Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
You need a ride?
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
I keep the heat on.
Better than what you give.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Let go of my arm...
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
LAZ, I said let...!
Or what? OR WHAT?
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Test. Shit. What kind'a test you thinkin'? You mean like, if you a man or not? If you a killer? Only one way to prove that. You just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
Uh-uh.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
We drinkin' buddies now?
By myself?
What I love.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
Ask the chef.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
What'd I tell you?  I don't do none of that shit no more. I'm in communications now.
So why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Nick, we can't just --
He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
Where would you look for the mafia?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
I don't, that's all.
I stole them.
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
No.
I can't...
Joyce?
Because we're the biggest things to hit this town since Godzilla.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
He's on duty.
He's got a reason.
Guess I'm on a roll.
He killed a police officer.
It is not allowed.
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
Where?
Oh?
And what can he do for you?
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
When do you deliver your project?
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing.  Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees.  Guess he found himself one.
She's not with you?
I'm coming to that.  Vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  A direct hit is a positive retirement.
Not if it works.
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Prosit.
I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
Do you recognize any of them?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Lots of places.  The tours, the clubs, the Silicone shows, private parties.
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
I bet I would.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Sounds like you speaks from experience.
Ugh.
I work alone.
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Go ahead.
Discreetly.
But how come I'd be there?
I was hoping you'd say that.
Is that why you're still here?
You like it?
Really?
How do you do?
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
Rogers Hornsby?!?
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Yes.
Heck, no!  What?!
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
It's Perry!
Oh, I could die...
Who are these people?
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Then forget it.
It does?
It didn't used to be that way.
Two weeks.
What?!
In the house?
Yes!
Not that one!
I like her.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
What?
Thanks.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
I'll try.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Who use to own it?
What's the capitol?
I don't think so.
That would knock my father out.
Yeah?
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
How old do I look?
I guess living up here makes people look older.
The sky!!!
Oh, that would be wonderful!
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Good.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
No.
Really?
What?
Yeah. Let's dig in!
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
No.
Yes.
--do as I say!
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Oh, yes.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Uh, yes, you do.
What?!!
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
Coward!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Why do you do it?
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
Oh yeah, that's good.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
Lie down on the bed.
See my breasts? See?
You don't?
No. What is happening?
Then don't talk about killing.
Yes.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Frank?
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Go where?
Nothing.
What kinda beer do you like?
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Alright.
Nothing. I'm fine.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
How is Central these days?
Terrible boring.
I'm here, aren't I?
Let's go.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
This is not my usual Friday night!
Yeah.
Are you sure?
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Yeah?
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
You didn't tell him about me?
You look beautiful.
Really?
NO.
Stop it Mike.
Oh fuck! 
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah.
Where's your gun?
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!!
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Right.
Aye.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
We'll find it. Just calm down.
No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
They were wearing masks.
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
Really want to know?
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
What are you serious?
Roc. You okay?
Hey, Murph.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
I guess not.
It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand.
God have mercy on my soul.
Just go!
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
No. This is he.
But Dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
I know about money, Anthony. I know the value of money. Plus the earrings are worth three times that.
I'm lookout.
Dignan! Stop!
Where's the other stocker?
Yeah.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Don't even say it, man.
I'll say it.
OK. Go ahead.
True.
Inez, this is --
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
Sure.
On the left.
Where was it parked?
Maybe he just went to the store.
That's a long time to be in jail.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Shh.
Bob!
I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.
Yes. I do.
So do I.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
Check the fucking elevator. It's moving.
Applejack! What's happening?
Get against the wall!
Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
What are you talking about?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Shield me from the bullets. They won't shoot civilians. Ready?
Technique. That's right. Seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. Seventy-five percent. Do you believe that?
Hold it.
The Abe Henry double-cross test. You just made a perfect score.
Yes, he did.
What was that?
Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the guy.
He looked too shaken-up.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
Uh-uh.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
What do you mean?
Where were you?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Bob! Get back in position!
I thought your parents were in Italy.
It's true, Dignan.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
That's your domain.
Yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
I told you they were there.
He wouldn't move.
I can't do that, Bob.
OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You know why? Because I don't care. He's Future Man. But I care about you. And to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. Will you get in the car, Bob? This is stupid.
Bullshit.
That's OK.
Jesus Christ.
Stand by. Bird Dog?
Let's go!
I didn't think there was an alarm.
He's stuck between two floors.
Do you have your own cell?
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
What?
I want to know about Treadstone.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Why not? It was just money.
And?
Then what?
I can't let you do that either.
I'm sorry.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I don't know who that is.
How long? How long do I have -- 
Conklin up front.
I should be better by now.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
-- not yet --
What if it's not who you think it is?
But you found another choice.
It might have.
Get on it.
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
Abbott?
So when was I here?
Careful...
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
So?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
I don't want to leave.
We must sue for peace.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
So I did! And what was so important about it?
You may.
I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
It's up to us, Hamish!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
I will not.
A common thief.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
That is not possible.
She was my wife. We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord. They killed her to get to me. And she was pregnant.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
I am trying.
They've tricked us.
So what did you find.
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
You know the answer to that.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Great. I'll see you soon.
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
You know my father?
I see a car.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
Books?
My journals! Where are they?
I thought you were a December baby.
Like Ozzy.
I'm sorry.
Duck, here they come.
Hi, Lenny.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
What?
And you are...?
Evan Treborn.
Destroy it?
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Oh, yes.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
Come up here a minute.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
Yes, sir.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
I'd better be going.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, of course, we --
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
The stairs from the street.
Put them on the table.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
Won't you join us for a drink?
Any time.
Thank you.
Had a close one, eh?
Yes, rather.
Very well.
We'll be there.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
And that is?
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Manages what?
His escape.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
Excuse me.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Serves me right for not being musical.
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
I haven't the slightest idea.
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
No.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
Yeah, boss?
Just a little something of my own.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Fix raft first.
Why do they have to die for me?
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
Well, I do a little drawing --
I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
You did?
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
Hey...hey...it's okay!
Is that Jango?
That about sums it up.
Yeah?
Not when you have no choice.
It means a lot...that you came.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Under the circumstances your overall health is good.  Those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
True enough.  No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know.
We're on.
To Wilson.
Hallelujah.
To life.
That's all there is.
Deliver this package.  Then, I dunno.
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
Oh...
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
He's leaving...
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
Of course.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
No trouble.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
Shit. We don't know what he is.
What view?
*You* taught her, I suppose...
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Yes. That's why I wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Your life flashing before your eyes?
That's not a bad place to start.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
In this case, you might say I want to know how not to play the Big Con.
Guess so.
Fine. But only if we recover the cash.
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
I guess. I gotta drop a dime. Did anybody mess up the hoop?
I just don't know if this says, "me". What's the fabric?
Leave him. Someone's going to find him eventually. Then they'll start looking for us, too.
Two million.
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
You sure?
Eight A.M. flight.
I have a good crew.
I can't do that.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Great. Thank you.
We're not cops.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
Uh-huh.
But the fucking Grand Poo-Bah of all jinxes? A bird in your house...
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
How do you know I will?
Don't ruin this for me.
No, I want my cut!
What do you want? An apology?
No, I want my cut!
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
What?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
This is embarrassing.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Okay. Here's the thing... You fall flat, you might not get anything short of stiffed. Then it's Blue River Land for everybody. Papers like these are dangerous because papers tend to multiply, then they start to take shape. Usually it's the shape of an arrow. I hate to do it, but after this, I gotta give you the blowoff. We Jake, Jake?
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
Roger that.
To who?
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
I'll take you up on that.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
I'm working on that soccer story.
You want me drunk?
I won't be that long.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
I've got something to tell you.
I had training. In the Republic.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Marion, stop this.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
I'm on at nine.
Why not?
Never. Why do you ask?
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
In the casino.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
What kind of trouble?
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
I'm Lucy.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
You won't. Not without permission.
Five.
How?
Fine.
Bruised.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
It didn't go off.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Well, there's the possibility of...
Do you remember the detonation time?
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Mafhkin oble groop...
Yes.
Any of 'em any good?
Veil nebula.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
What?
You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
How come I never hearda you before?
This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
Where?
Don't look down.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
I don't get involved with guns.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Who is...
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
The other ones?
C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
Hardly...
Your help.
I'm sorry.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
You did.
Right here someplace.
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
Bastard...
One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
Yeah.
How long you and me known each other?
A long time.
Only one I can think of.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
Right, the big one-oh.
Really?
And you were a sympathetic ear.
A toy?
Easy Sketchy.
Okay, okay, okay--
I was on call. 
He's sick.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
Gin.
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
And he loves you back, doesn't he?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
Believe it.
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
I'm really sorry about that, man.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
That's it?
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Trip? You just got yourself four tickets and four backstage passes to KISS live at Cobo Hall tonight!
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
You'll know soon enough.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
School's cancelled.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
What makes you think I'm not?
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Yeah?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
Grandma Death.
I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand, son, is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
Don't you watch the news?
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
What is her name?
Have you ever made love, Donald?
But you were punished.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
How is that possible?
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Yeah.
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
How did you know --
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Yes, I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
My mom wanted me to have this?
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
Ah! It's from State! Oh my God!
Your parents'd kill you.
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
It's okay.
You heard me. Where is it?
I know.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
All right, they're makin' a movie.
I got a hairdo.
Okay?
Wisconsin.
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
Guess it wasn't a garage sale as much as it was a bake sale. Ah- hahahahahahahaha!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
"My dear President"...
Take another letter...  to my tailor.
Take a letter...
No, but I shot some ducks.
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
She did.
Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
I can't do it...
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
Go ahead.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Let him patch up his own breeches...
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
I've always thought that myself.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
Everything will be seen to.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
Are you comfortable here?
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
That's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. I have something else for you...
Want to come out?
Yes.
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
...I learned a long time ago.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Righteousness for his namesake.
Thank you very much.
Not at all, John.
...Can you cure me?
You did this for me?
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
Very smart indeed.
And who might you be, sir?
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
Open up! I know you're in there!
I said welcome.
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them?
But you LOVED her all the same...
Oh, for goodness' sake!
SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
Why?
Don't talk nonsense.
Oh, get it over with.
What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
You DON'T like it, do you?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Why... should YOU care?
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
Row! Row! Row!
Make your mind up.
What "magic"?
Look... Erik...
Now stop it!
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Like fish.
To the oars!
We haven't got a spare place.
I have to go...
What do we have to do?
He hasn't.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
Get away, Snorri.
You could charge him what you like.
Yes yes... of course.... the "Blacksmith's Code"...
But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the Horn Resounding... if he ever crosses Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
YOU do it!
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
But it's a responsibility...
No... he's not... not... there...
Yes, Mum.
And keep your sword greased.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
Okay, I guess.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I like it.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
I know a man who needs a refill.
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
I think about that.
That's scary sounding.
Yes.
You'll call me, right?
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
I don't want to talk about this here.
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
No, it isn't that.
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
I'm right here.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Hi.
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Seems too coincidental that way.
I think we should go.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
When?
Make love?
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
Shit!
I know what it is.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
It was a mutual decision.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Just wanted to let you know.
You can if you want.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
I know who you are.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Whooee!
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
I'll get him.
On my way.
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
Can you shut it down?
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
Please... kill...
Oh God...
Starck!
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
Frozen.
Crystallized.
Thanks.
NSA encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
What could cause them?  What's in the Core?
How much time do you need? We have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. Now: what is in the Core?
Your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. It may have killed one of my men.  No one goes near that thing.
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
Starck... Cooper...
Locked and cocked.
One-four degrees...
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
Justin?
Let's go.
No. I'll be right back.
They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able...
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Decompression wouldn't do that.
No, there's no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. It's as if time just... stopped for seven years.
I like the sound of that.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Ben. Are you okay?
Reed?... Sue?
Go back to the drawing board.
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
No: You're ON FIRE!
Oh, it is.
Johnny.
I think that thing is Ben.
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
And that's a good thing?
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
Yes, thanks.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
If it happened to him, then it could...
Excuse me?
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
I gave him twenty.
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Sure.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Susan. What are you doing?
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
There it is!
They're not home yet.
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
Why?
But they weren't mine.
You're fired.
Oh, really?
What? Now?
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
All right. Pay attention.
Really.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
That's me, Merv.
Totally.
All right.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
Just be glad you're all right.
So what did you do?
If I didn't have a fianc in Chicago, I'd go for it.
What variables?
What's the big deal?
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
What do you think it is?
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
I couldn't make it in time.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
We keep them.
Oh... yes.
I've heard that, too.
Not at all.
Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.
I'll get you the notes.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Two Cokes.
Awake? What do you mean?
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
Jesus! Did I say that?
You whore!
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
Can we make it?
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done.
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
They were all veterans.
She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself.  I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it?
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
Her fella.
But it's got teeth.
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
Well, justice is funny.
There's a tunnel.
What?
We lived near power lines.
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
But not flush against the tunnel?
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
How much you got?
What?
Nine?
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
No bullshit.
Duh hickey.
Move slow and move quiet.
Get something on that.
Am I too heavy for you?
Nothing, just lookin'.
Wait God-dammit!
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
Come here. I want to show you something.
Who is she?
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
Who?
You're under arrest.
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
Address?
Not me. But other people seem to.
You think I'd miss it?
Enh.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
You jackass!  C'mon, let's get out of here.
You're telling me.
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
Calm down, Frances.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
Who said I was a lady?
I guess.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Huh?
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
I got your number, Mister Man.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
You got it.
Yes, Ma.
You're taking me home!
You kill me, Mama.
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
Oh bullshit.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
Yeah?
'Incurable.'
Kill me and have done with it.
I see it before me.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
Quite right!
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
I'll have to do better than that.
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I wish to be your wife.
They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
I know only that he is a killer. And I shall bring back his carcass.
Open this door for no-one!
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Of course I am. It pays to humor the insane.
I resent God's monopoly.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
You know of it?
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
Artist.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Well, it hasn't been that long.
Okay.
Somebody'll see.
For sure.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I had to.
Dancer.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Coach, athletic director somewhere.
Okay, Fireman.
I mean...
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
Stop? We're not going to actually stop at a motel, are we?
The truth hurts.
No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that they're back there.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
She's dead?
Yes, they do.
You want me to sit here and be passive. The only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe you'll let us go. I'm not there yet. You have to convince me you're telling the truth.
I can handle Richie, don't worry.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
In the Winnebago.
Amen.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
What you said to me in the room.
Yes.
-- you got your microwave --
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Knock yourself out.
Six-fifty.
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
This bar is for bikers and truckers only.  You, get out!
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
What?
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Don't worry about it, we'll get you some glasses.
You know what you look like?
Yeah, it's mine.
No problem, lieutenant.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Did you hear?
Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
... two... one... MARK!
Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line?
Get it up!
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
What?
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
Your new roommate.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
North?
Thought you two were file-closed.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Women.
Well, I can be tough if I want.
Nearly four years...
We know, Audrey.
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
It's good to see you, Nick.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
I left my forgery kit back at the office.
What do I get?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
I'll try.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Get your people out of there or I will.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
Then you're perfect.  Here's your radioactive sample. Study it.
That's right.
It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
I need you to trust me.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I-
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
I'm... I'm shot.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
THIS much.
I heard something. A squeal.
Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo-
The ships are gaining...
Alex? Where are you going?
To see if there's a pub.
Okay...  Okay, now what.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
Okay, now. But-
Yes?
There is no weather in space.
... What does that mean?
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
It's suicide.
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
No. Keep all energy to the armor.
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
Sure, no problem.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
Theramin.
... Maintenance facility...
And determination.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
How about the pig-lizard?
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Because they're coming right at us.
Exceedingly.  Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon!
They died well.  Otherwise, they didn't do much right.  But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops:  right now they have no other enemies.
I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck!
They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
I?  You all know my history.
No, my lord.
Yes, my lord.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
Yes, I believe so.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
No, I did not.  Really?  Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely?
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit.
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
I rode here, on my horse.
General Lee, sir!
Surely you knew this was coming.
Some things must never change.
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
George, I'm sorry.
Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
Or, 'civilized'.
Just because they are born?
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
No. What's this?
You think I'd be standing here? You set somebody up and you want it to work, it has to be a surprise. Can you remember that?
You spotted them, huh?
How 'bout when you went down the stairs?
You gave him the money?
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
Three.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
Bear, you're not really gonna -
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
Whenever you want it. The money's in hundred dollar bills inside one of those jock bags, you know? In a locker at the airport, waiting to be picked up.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Never heard of him.
Ray. Look at me.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
That's the idea. I'll think about it.
We just did. I told you my name's Chili Palmer.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
What does that mean?
Maybe a few times I have.
Really? You ever been arrested?
Racketeering, that covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?
For a movie?
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -
That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
I said I'd think about it. What does that mean? In this town, nothing.
His shrink's trainer.
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
Personally?
What Get Away jet?
With what? Wiseguy money?
I believe it.
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" - which by the way was a better book than a movie - did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
"Cotton".
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
There a part in it for you?
You don't like Martin much, do you?
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
Really.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
You don't act like it?
I'm going into the movie business.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
You seem to feel fine about it.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
I don't hear anything.
That's where you got the idea?
Shylock?
Really.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. The vessel Chimera was registered to The Dobbins Kirk Line, Halifax.  Nova Scotia. Date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. Over.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
That's what it says.
Damn mind of it's own.
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
Maybe he isn't alone.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
Murphy.
Not me.
I think you know.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
What guy?
Collision? With what?
Hey.
Wish I could say the same.
I don't know, are we?
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Who?
What?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
Really? I never really cared for those. Why does the fat one always have to be so mean to the skinny one?
Hello...
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
Oh my God, that's HIM!
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Yeah, well --
Okay... I promise.
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
How perfect.
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
I've been looking all over for this.
Oh yeah.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
Everybody's too stupid!
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
I don't believe you.
He does that every single day.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
Maybe an orange juice.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
It's kind of falling apart.
Yeah yeah yeah. Do you have my money?
Get a job!
Five hundred.
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Jesus!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
OH MY GOD!
These are older women just dressed up to look young... I think.
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
I dunno... they're very sensitive at work about all this stuff. Maybe it would be better if you --
I'm starting to think that even if I did get a girlfriend it really wouldn't change anything.
Oh yeah?
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
YAAA!
Really?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What about this?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Yeah, well... me neither...
Maybe she was just using you to try and get back at some guy. Who knows? It could be a million things. It's wasted time trying to logically figure out the female brain, that's for sure.
Yeah.
Talk to us about it...
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Right, exactly!
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
That slut!
It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
But overall, you're pleased?
Yes he is.
And it worked?
Who else would hire me?  Beat you to it, didn't I?  Oh yes, almost forgot- brought you a little welcoming gift. 
Then why do it?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he? But that's all right- after all, I'm responsible for everything that happens here. And it certainly won't do much for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.
Got me out of trouble.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
I'll be bait alone?
You think they'll come then?  Why?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
I don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
I'd rather not.
Do you ever see him?
Oscar!  You poor kid!
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
I must be losing my mind.  At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
The Upper West Side.
Maybe they just want to appeal.
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
I don't even want to know where that is.
They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
Ostrov?  I've been there.  Good party town.
Do it!  Just do it!
There's something very familiar about this painting.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
And decent.
Uuuuuuugh!!
What's the matter, dear?
... I thought it was the drug store.
So what do you think it was?
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
It's in the stars.
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
That's it.  Get out.
Out!
I'll scream.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
He is the Destructor.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Here are tonight's calls.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
See!  They are using drugs.
... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Wow!
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
You talked to Gozer?
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
We'd better adjust our streams.
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
Look!
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
That's what you told me two days ago!
Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me.
For the gods, spit it out!
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
I am their hero!
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed.
Caesar?
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
The Senators admire you.
What deal?
Well, they die for it!
The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
I don't want you to die!
That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
Before they leave, get gold.
Something else, then.  Do the chariot races interest you?
Are you going to graduate school?
But, Elaine --
I just want to tell you something.
We won't. Let's go inside.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Of course not.
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
And it's all over now.
Yes.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Because I want to know what's happening.
Is it because I'm here?
Let me go.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Don't you have it on?
Why wouldn't it?
I just don't think it would...
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
I certainly hope you --
Ahhh.
Oh -- no sir.
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
I'm in the bathroom.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
What?
What? No. Nothing.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Oh no.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Whatever you say, sir.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
What?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Why not?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What do you think?
Well I don't know.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Her portrait?
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
Right.
Would you like me to seduce you?
Waiter!
Well -- I don't know.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Yes -- I think that would be good.
Benjamin.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Okay.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Wait a minute.
If you want.
How about art.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Now let's keep going here.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
We don't.
No we don't.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
What was your major?
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Let's drop it.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
Don't start acting hurt.
Of course you did.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
You don't?
That has nothing to do with it --
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
How long have we known each other now?
I will.
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Yes?
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
Who?
You?
Very little.
Aren't you?
All right. We'll dance.
Sorry.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
I'll do anything for you.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
I want to be alone.
What?
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I don't want them now.
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
You do believe that I really love you?
Don't worry. I'll be on the train.  He leaves.
No?
Bless you --
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
Be quiet.
Nobody, Doctor.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
No -- I must find it --  Fourteen thousand two hundred marks. 
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
No - absinthe.
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
You don't understand that do you?
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Moreover --
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Have you got it now?
Well -- you want me?
Well?
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Oh, yes.
You think so?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
There was -- there was.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
You're discharged.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
You are late. Hurry.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
You're a thousand percent right!
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Goody!
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has--  -- you don't mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. If he could...
Henry, no!
I certainly hope not.
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
These machines -- They're in here.
What? He's going to be all right!
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Hello.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
No. That was the point.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
That's pretty funny, all right. What happened in Phoenix?
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
I know you do, so that's why --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I am in school.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
Oh, come on, Roy.
I'm a salesman.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
What?
That's what I say.
Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I've seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. But you don't make it work forever.
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
) What?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
Yes, I know, I know.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
No, its -- Why did she--?
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
Girl scouts.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
It's Amy Kramer.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Would somebody shut this guy up?
No.  Wait for the police.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
I'm not leaving without her.
John...
Please, get on the bus...
You okay?  You seem a little off.
I'm fine.  I just need to lie down...
Never.
Yeah.
Can't you hold it?
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
He says things.  Bad things.
I've come to help your family.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Mrs. Blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
Wait a minute ...
I'm here now, Jamie.  You're going to live. You have to.
Leave the boy.  Take me.
I'm Tommy.  Tommy Doyle.  Laurie Strode -- Jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
No one.
You know what gets me?
Go home!
Go home!  Show them how rich you are for a change!
You know what gets me?
I dunno.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
In what way, pray tell?
Okay.  Okay.
I know you think that.
You're making a joke.
For what?
You're hollow, like a woman.
Thank God!
Man and boy.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
They were in the same creative writing class.
It makes life spicy.
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
Make it fast.
A hundred dollars for breakfast?
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
Open the bolt!
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
We thought a doctor might help.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
I'm not going to strike you.  I am going to be as gentle as pie--as lemon meringue pie.  You mustn't run away now.  This is your loving husband approaching.  I'm your husband.  Society approves!
It couldn't!
Why not?
He cried.
I feel mocked, insulted, with no sort of satisfaction in prospect. We don't have to fight with steel. I can fight with words.  I'm not an inarticulate ape, you know, who grabs a rock for want of a vocabulary.  Call him up in East St. Louis, Penelope.  Tell him to come here.
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
Do it, Norbert.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Will you please go?  An emergency!
I've literally got to run!
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fianc is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye.
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
I see.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Don't shoot.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Thank you.  You can leave now.  We'll begin.
I dunno.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  I did.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
What will you do, Colonel?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Kid--kid--
I know.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
To only exercise Dr. Woodly ever gets is playing the violin and making that stupid peace sign.  Peace.  Peace.  Peace, everybody.
Father's friend.
Don't know.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
I don't get it.
He can hardly talk.
It is an emergency, isn't it?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
Don't worry about it.
It's fine!
They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
Take plenty of cigars.
Meaning?
They didn't murder me.
Paul's only twelve years old.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
It's really that bad?
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Are you going to stiff me?
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
'Film Producer seeks young men, 18 to 25, for hardcore film. Prior film experience a must. Call Jake at Players Motel. 777 Vine. 463-5671.
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Nah.
Do you know where she would be?
Tod might know.
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Huh?
No.
Say what?
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
No.
Neither am I.
Is Kristen safe?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Where is she?
I don't know.
They're legal now.
They are?
I don't know.
What's it called?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
I just heard. Who is he?
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Who?
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
You working in San Diego now?
No.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
How long have you been driving?
Your tree.
Lady! Be quiet.
What?
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Eh, fine.
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
It's so blue.
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
For you.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
Mother.
What?
Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
You think so, sir?
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
To pit your own life against another.
Yes.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Well, I don't...
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Well, I didn't.
Shit. Bull. Shit.
It certainly is.
What's the matter with her?
What?
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
Because I'm going to get my father!
I've come for my father!
And what about you?
Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. No, YOU talk to me. But -- do me a favor? -- none of this DEMONS crap.
Who?
You mean, outside... with her.
In private, if you don't mind...
From where??!!
Reliquary --
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
Got tired of me?
I can live with that.
Each of us gets a belt.
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Start in, you got nachos coming.
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
My fucking hand!
Many times.
No. That wasn't the deal.
It's important.
Come to Daddy.
I'm brother Frank.
Forget him.
Back from where?
What?
Not know.
Who did?
And the blood let you out?
I said no.
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
Oh my God.
No, you're not.
I'll be scarred for life.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
Do you care ?
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Steve.
I got through.
YOU'D like my room.
O.K.
Kirsty.
I don't believe it.
What's the problem?
I AM house-trained.
It's late.
What do we do if there isn't?
It's not what I heard.
Well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
It's a fetish of mine.
I won't let anybody take you.
Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me --
Technically, I'm number one.  I went out with her a week before Kevin did.  Her first boyfriend.  Me.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
What did he ever do to you?
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
Not really.
HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
We work there!
Where's Rob?
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Good weekend?
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Do it.  Do it.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
My house?
What's the obvious stuff?
What, what?
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
Will you call me?
Is that the last of it?
You still together?  Going all right?
Ray.  I hate Ian.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Hi.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
No, but...
Wanna go to dinner?
Just local, of course.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
Not in love, exactly, but...
Fair enough.
So?
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
Yup.
That way.
Right.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
I knew this was going to happen.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Fuck off.
How old is Richard?
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
It's not mine.
Grave robbers?
Miss Cartwright, you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you.  I strongly suggest you return to Washington and stay out of small town cemetaries.
Why not?
That bothers you?
You are being foolish.
You are.  Now.
When you finish, what then?
Follow me.
I see.
Damn you.
Not power.  Not control.
Yes.
What do you want from me?
Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
-Et lux perpetua-
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
We are immortal.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
Aye.
Hide.  Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn.  You must learn to defend yourself.  In this I can help.
But why be so concerned about me?
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
Do what you must.
Not likely.
Second musketeer.
It can be different.  It must be.
Stay out of it.
He's a MacLeod.
I do hope she enjoys a good show.
Go to hell.
Should I care?
What are you getting at?
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
I'll send them right up.
Same.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Hildy!
It doesn't have to rhyme!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
But --
I'm sure you haven't any.
Thank you.
Fine.
No -- she didn't.
You haven't seen anything yet.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
I notice you still remember it.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  Is he as good as you say?
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Huh!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Finished!
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Murder, uh?
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
Where'd you wire him?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
They're always after me for interviews.
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
Three bullets! Any good?
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
So long, Hildy.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
Cover up that transmitter!
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Come on with that money!
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far.
Why?
But Grandpa, you said...
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
Looking for shrapnel.
We thought it was poison.
...and six...
The sodding water table.
A bit too quick.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
Please yourself.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
Except the servicemen.
Naturally.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
It's not. It's happening to me.
I wish it could all have been different.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
Cone.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
OK.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Whoopie fucking doo.
Nice.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Yeah, I'll do something.
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Holy crap, thanks!
The Duke?
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
I'll help ya.
Thanks.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
What I need are some answers. 
Hmmmmmmmmm?
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
I hear ya.
That's nice.
Oh, yeah.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
That's the understatement of the year.
Firefly.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
What should I do?
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
Well, go get her.
That's it?
I pray to God there is.
You know, his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
When you were a little French girl?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Unnhh.
Hi. It's Nathan.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I want to be the way I was before.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Please, honey, let me in.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true.
We are animals after all.
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
Do you?
Yes, darling.
What?
I don't know. Something.
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Your entire body?
Of course not.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
Ummm. It's good.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Yes.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Next game, ten bucks.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
You know what's good for him?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
How much do I owe you?
What did he say?
Yeah? Why?
What is?
He drank as much whisky as you did.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Seventy-five per cent.
You think I can lose?
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
'Bout even.
Well, here it's half.
And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
Who's he?
Yeah, that's right.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Eddie...
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
That's right. When?
What?
How long have you been waiting?
What bus?
Yours.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Thanks. I will.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
No, not always.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
I drink.
You told me.
Mm hmm.
From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
Is that what makes a winner?
I love you.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
For how long?
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Just for luck.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
Is that a fact?
Where do you come from?
That's right.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
You name it.
Yes.
Do you want to go on?
What about... now?
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
Where you lived with them.
You want to kill them.
I only protect myself -- !
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
If we want it, it is.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
What, Jim, what?
It was so real, Dad.
It's his nightmare.  He still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
May I ask why?
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
I'd believe him.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
Don't go over the hill, Mom. Please.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
What kind, Mom?
Why, yes.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
He's a good man.
You bet it did.
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
She always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. Sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
Oh shit, we're late.
Looks like they're preparing the invasion.
And get those helicopters away from the ship. Call them back immediately.
We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.  If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
And our troops here?
My God, the Vice President and the Joint Chiefs...
He's doing a good job.
I should have done this a long long time ago.
Was his father stationed here?
Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
Command, Eagle One. Switching to "sidewinders." We're moving in.
Jimmy, stay with me.
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
Except he's lost, and I'm not.
You said go between them!
What were they looking for?
Well, what was left of him.
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
They want my diary.
I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
Umh?
Head for the fireplace!
...the solution presents itself.
What?
This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Thanks.
Penitent. Penitent...
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
I don't need camels.
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
Then we'll die.
Who are you?
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
Siam.
Their children?
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
A snake!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
Just one arm!
That's good -- you're doing fine.
I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket.
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
Oh really?
You want me so bad, why don't you invite me?
I am -- it looks horrible!
No... the heart's still beating!
Maybe... someday.  Not today.
You've got to go to sleep now.
They got no food to feed them. So they taking the elephants away to sell them.
What for?
You're not gonna believe this...
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Yeah?
Where are we now?
Right.
Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
I just went there for a job.
What for?
Then I'm crazy.
Yeah.
I'll talk to them.
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
I don't know. I don't want to find out.
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
I am. You are.
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
What am I supposed to do?
Eating sushi?
You eat it.
A girl.
Wait.
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
...Rene...
Without your pants.
I made it work.
This...is not going to work out.
Why not?!
Doesn't.
That place. By the window.
Just hold them close and stay still.
I don't know!
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
Shit! You're in love.
Fountainhead of High-Tech.
Relax. Let me do this.
One of your instincts?
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
haka xuki. What's that mean?
It's not the one...Wait... there's a label.
Where've you been?
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
Rene?
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
What part what?
Let us get to the border!
She found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
Me.
Newer, more powerful design.
It is to me too.
I don't know...the last couple of hours...last few days.
Oh...that's okay.
Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you
Take the card.
Nothing.
I am confused. Or maybe it's you.
...right here too.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
I am sort of scattered.
You are.
Why do you do it?
You're doing...Okay.
Who else is interested in me?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
He didn't.
You did.
He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch.
It was my choice.
We just don't stop.
If he was able, what would he say.
We're not moving fast enough for him.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
Why'd you invite me here?
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
What about the others.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Hi, Daddy.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Where?
Lowell?
Three hours.
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Tell her I'll call her back in ten.
Oh, I love that stuff.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
You're taking "no" for an answer?
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests...  "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger...  Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..."
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
No, no, we're fine...
Why?
You ready...?
Soy sauce...
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
What?!
What are you and Mike going to do?
Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Okay. Thank you.
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
What?
Lowell.
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
How have you liked your stay?
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Did work.
Why am I gonna mention your name?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
They should be.
You okay?
Next to your father?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens?
I'll call them, Lowell.
No? No, what?
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
Where you staying now?
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
He's the wrong man.
Yes?
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
Yes.
Huh?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
But you don't agree?
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Miles?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
No. Don't stop.
No, we're not!
No.
You do?
Fabric and fringe.
What do you want?
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
That's marriage.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
Well what does he want?
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Rex, please.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
Nothing?
Maybe I should reconsider my...
Sorry.
I am very sorry.
Is she going through with it?
Miles -- why so angry?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
What...?
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
Maybe next time.
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
How is she?
Whyuhshe's all right, sir.
"I found a million dollar baby"
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Yes, I knowbut
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Well!
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
No, I'll go through with it.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses.  Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike. 
Smart aleck!
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
Must be the Spring.
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Next week "East Lynne."
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
Yes.
This isn't "piggy-back."
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
Thought you were hungry!
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Hayin my teeth.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight!
Amazing.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Thank you.
Why, he'll be back.
Oh, excuse me. 
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
I'd put you there myself.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn!  Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.
Mush. Mush.
Send it collect.
What?
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
They put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing.  I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza.  Truth is, I never met the dude.
Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
Yeah, I guess you do.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
Why?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
It leads farther than that.
What do you mean?
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
They're Agency, too.  Don't you get it?  CIA and Mafia together.  Trying to whack out the Beard.  Mutual interests.  They been doing it for years.  There's more to this than you dream.  FBI fucking hates the CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too.  Check out "Alan Pope" in Miami.  Jack Youngblood. Bill Harvey.  Colonel Roselli.  The shooter, I hear, was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard he shot his own partner.  Got that? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas. H.L. Hunt.  He's dirty.  That's all I know.  But the Agency always runs the show.  Check out something called "Mongoose"  Operation Mongoose. Government, Pentagon stuff, they're in charge, but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows, fun 'n' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that's the next big number - the heroin trail.  "Oh, what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive."
I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel better in the morning.  We'll talk then.
A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another hour?
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
David Ferrie.
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
May I go?  Regardless of what you may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am a patriot first and foremost.
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
What are you driving at, boss?
...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands - new shoe leather. Look at the ear of the cop... That's a wire.  What's a cop wearing a headset for?  I think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
Between six and seven seconds.
Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston?  There's plenty of time - he's out in the open - a frontal shot?
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
No, it can't!
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
It never did. 
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren Report.  He tried to get Oswald a lawyer.  Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?
You're so naive, mister.
We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
How many men are working with you on this?
Six.
Uh huh.
Yes, Max, I understand.
Uh-huh.
Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
I found out.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
That's him. How do you know 'em?
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D., but you didn't mention the Federal.
How many trips did you make?
He's got that kinda money?
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Sure.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
You're gonna offer to set him up?
How was it?
I go back to work tomorrow.
They seem to like the idea.
You don't actually do it that way?
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
The day you got me out of jail?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?
Set him up.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
We're partners.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
What the fuck is that shit?
You know what we want.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
What for?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
She didn't say.
Uh-huh.
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
Not in the fitting room.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
I thought you were watching him.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
I have no evidence of your taking anything. You didn't pay for your snazzy new suit with marked bills; I was glad to see that. You've been helping us out, you gave us Melanie and Louis. Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her, which goes a long way backing up your story.
I'm waiting for the phone.
What were you two fighting about?
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Are you getting that black suit?
Yeah.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
What did they say?
If you want.
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
That's the idea.
So we need two people, two women.
What'd you care?
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
Designer clothes.
Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Susanville.
Bank robbery.
No.
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Guess where I am?
You can't trust Melanie. But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
How much it there?
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Pull the car over.
Have fun.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
You didn't hear?
Did the police contact you?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
Uh-huh.
Call her, tell her the combination.
She will.
No problem.
He leave town?
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
Goddamn it. What kind of bullshit is that?
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
Tell your mother.
Don't go.
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
That was set. I'm tellin' you.
What else did he say, Jake?
A couple of weeks, I think.
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
Sarah.
She hates me, Louis.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
I don't know. I've been having them recently.  You know, you look like an angel, Louis, an overgrown cherub. Anyone ever tell you that?
I'm walking, aren't I?
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
I don't know what to say.
I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
Your back? Did you fall?
Gee, thanks a lot.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
What?
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
When was the last time I said a word?
Where are we?
We're at Della's.
It's gone to the top.
Here. I'll do it.
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
It's so hard to believe.
Bullshit!
I promise.
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
You look upset.
Mid-town mostly.
Sit down, Jake.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
I don't know.
Well that's good to know.
I no from around here.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
Hot. Where do I sign?
Where am I?
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
Speaking.
Paul Gruneger!
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
You can't talk in Brownsville?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
Who is?
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
Bring it in.
Pause play.
We don't have time to argue!
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
We don't have a choice!
Rizzo did.
And you said high school was boring.
They're back here.
Two more charges to go.
You're a teacher.
Fine, just stay out of my way.  Hit it.
Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.
You got that right.
Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
Fuckin A...
And what happend to ...?
Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
I think I had some when I was eight.
More time...shit, she's had 400 years...
He's right behind us!
Just come on, I've got an idea.
GO, GO, GO!
Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
Sory...
Ssh.
What?!!
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Are you finished?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
You're crazy!
Three...two...one...
I want him out of the ocean.
Here --  Take him home.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
It's my charter. My party.
No!
Full throttle! To port!
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
I was only reacting to what I was told.
I'm going home.
Why?
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
What d'ya mean?
Rogue?
You could say that.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
We gotta get back soon...
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
You picked her up on the ferry.
That wasn't funny.
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer.
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
Let it go, don't waste your time.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
The shaft is giving.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye.
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
I know.
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Not this time. You don't have any reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart. I should be royally ticked at you, man. I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
Blood and guts.
I know what junk is.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
You're gonna like this, I promise.
No?
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
Room with a toilet, got it.
Your name, please?
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Only the one in my pants.
That is sick, man.
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
You're not listening to me.
Share the love, Tits!
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
A Pilates machine?
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Karma.
Do what?
...Anything else?
That's not true!
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
The party?
...just like that?
Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
I don't want to talk about it.
She wasn't feeling so good.
No.
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
Could be.
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Yeah.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Right.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Fifteen for me.
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
I like you too.
Of course I do.
Come dance.
Were you protected?
Everything is wrong.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit. Him and his ape ass of a friend Casper, they all just almost killed some kid.
What happened?
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah.
That's right.
Not too late.
Four-thirty in the morning?
Not too late.
Where does everyone sleep?
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
I can't man.
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
I wouldn't know.
You ever do any hunting, Peter?
Local?
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
But you said you didn't know her.
Just like who?
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
How?
You're damn right!  I'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Who's Kathy?
How long has she been dead?
Six, eight hours tops.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
We're not sure.
What about the way he arranged the body?
I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
This ain't no photo.
What does that mean?
We're going to work on the message.
You don't have a shred of evidence!
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
Are we going to go through this again?
Then I'll transpose.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
About what?
Who says something's on my mind.
Exactly... and you did this.
It's alright.
How come you don't stay with them?
Sounds very violent.
I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
But you're the key.  The one he wants to play the game with.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
You've got to face the things you feel.
How could you think that, Kathy?  How could you even consider it?
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
But I do.
Why not?
I got lucky.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
I have no intention of getting used to it.
<u>What</u>?
I can't.
About what?
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
Even by you?
I have need of friends.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
No.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
There's no way to outrun it. You know that. This is what Ynyr was preparing me for. It's what he died for.
I am Quell.
Sugarballs?
I have a cinnamon bar.
I am Ergo the Magnificent, and I do not travel with thieves and robbers.
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
If that were so, you'd be dead now. He was aiming at the Dark One, for there is ancient hatred between them. Once his race had two eyes, like other men, until his forefathers bargained with the Dark Ones: they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future. But they were cheated, for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death.
Then look!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
How many did you lose?
It is too late. He has drunk.
She was not as beautiful.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
Yes.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
You will come with me.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
...Good...  But what's special in him?
I'll explain you, Leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: My job, I'm a hitman and my employer is Tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  That's why you can't have a bank account!
130... 140...
Whoever.
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
...Because I feel it.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
Mathilda, stop, please!
...Later.
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
Yes.
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Huh? That's smart!
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
No... Dino's.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
How long does this... Mania last?
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
We can do it together.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
I've changed my mind.
Don't be so sure.
Where?
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
Doubts?  About what?
Jumped where?
Mammoth.
The Gazette's small huh?
Maybe.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
I told you.
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
She never ate a slice.
It's mine to risk.
No more words.  Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words.
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
What?  Who are you?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Orange soda?
No.
No -- S.E.R.A.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
What do you mean?
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Right... OK...
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
Let's stay for a while.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
Sera... please go.
But it's a top three school --
I believe we are.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
How?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Who's askin'?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Huh?
Tell him, Paulette.
I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood!
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Was she carrying a weapon?
See?
That's terrible!
Is she as pretty as you?
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Name?
I know. He has it sent out.
Maybe you should sleep with the judge too. Then we can win the case.
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
Josh proposed!
No way --
So?
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
I just don't understand what went wrong --
Where's Warner?
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
No.
Thank you.
Where's the Rock?
You're right. Phew!
Fire moat... why do that?
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
Like some vile toadstool.
To be my bride, of course.
Do it now!
What do you want from me?
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
I'm in no mood for dancing.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
Will you lead me to her?
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Stealing his arms?
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Easily spoken...
There aren't enough arrows.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Mean you to seek him out below?
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
Hurry up!
I could have struck off his head just now!
By the pond.  She was teasing me.
I may have said perhaps...
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
He did run?
Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
It's the Baron's damnable work!  Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
And I love you, my husband.
Biting you?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Not very precise directions.
No!
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
I pray God grants it me.
I'd be honored.
How so?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
Be fair, Oona.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
I checked everywhere.  He's not there.
What color?
Uh...using Josh like that.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
What are you doing here?
He jumped into the ocean.
I'm coming in.
I don't want you to!
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Not really.
It could have been a squirt gun.
Oh, yes.
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
Months.
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
Maybe...?
Forty.
Well, it's the least I can do.
She didn't really say.
We're getting out of the ground today.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
George, this is the third time.
Because I live there.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
No.
You can't promise me anything!  You don't have anything to promise!  You live in a garage!  You don't have cable!  You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer!  You don't have a job!
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
How do you become something you're not?
Nothing.
I'm telling you now.
I gave up on you.
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
Are you taking them still?
I still don't know what that means.
I'd build a house.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
Thanks for telling me.
Because Dad left?
Where is he?
The garage.
I want him with me.
What?
The first and the last.
What have you been before today?
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
Going on?
You bit my finger.
I didn't think you'd come today.
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
Don't even...I'm there.
A man he respects.
Should I?
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
You can't go because of Sam?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
Despite you.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Take it off.
You got a dog?
I locked the door!  Get out!  I locked the door!  Get out!
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
In the bedroom.
Is Mae Rose okay?
She's doing just fine.
She's alright, isn't she?
Married?
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
No, tell me what's so funny.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
That's right, a loan officer.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
What gave you that idea?
Still got that ten dollars?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
That jelly you were talking to right here?
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
You know what I'm saying.
What does that mean?
Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it.
On your behalf. What happened to we?
What'd you say?
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
I'd have knocked you off those bottles, put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now.
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Go where, Ray?
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
No problem. Oh, boy!
Why ain't that pick swinging?
He's a good friend of mine. Drops by the club whenever he's in town.
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
Nothing to it, really. Claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. They got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. Then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. Claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning.
Don't worry about that. Hey, fellas, this here is my mama. These are some of my friends. That's Willie, there's Poker Face, Radio, Cookie, Goldmouth, Biscuit, Jangle Leg.
No, it says Marleen here.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
I'm calling you out, brother...
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
Put it in your mouth.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Boogerland!
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
Why would you be floating?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
East Rutherford.
We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
You prefer women?
He was killed.
Killed? Why do you use that word?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
You felt sad. What's your name?
But you put yourself on the circuit!
Curious.
Not about that.
But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
I'm going to run.
About running, dying what?
That's tomorrow.
Where? Sanctuary? Can you take me there?
I -- I can't.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
I won't.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Beloved wife...
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
What people?
Do you want to see Doc?
For as long as I can remember.
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
Oh, yes... I think...
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
I don't think so.
No. Fred hates them.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
It's me...
Okay.
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
No... Here he comes.
When he went to work, right.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
Same one you were reading the other night?
From the club. You didn't answer.
Was there?
You will.
We just killed a couple of people...
Great question!! In the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... This uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Yeah.
Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
I don't know.
I don't remember... What happened that night?
You really don't remember?
It was weird...
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Oh, read it!
I'm a paleontologist.
I see.
I just feel as though I'm being made ready for the executioner.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
Certainly not!
They were in a quandary, and
Come on, Lovey.
In a quandary.
All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now.  Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
You mean you don't want to go?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
Thank you.
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
When was all this?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
108 and still active?
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
No porters here!!
Yes.
Oh, dear.
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
Come on! Quick! This way.
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
It's far from over, from what I can see. This place gives me the creeps, hidden away like this - no contact with civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned at all.
Let me go, Bob!
Why not? What's going to stop me?
So you think I'm mad?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
What's she got to do with it?
Why not?
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
That fellow got on at Baskul.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
We'd be eternally grateful if you
hope you'll forgive me for
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
Why?
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
What the hell...
You got smeared.
Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
Yes, air? -- OOOMPH.
Well this didn't.
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
Sir--
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
Actually that's a very good question.  The answer-- if You'll Just look at this Part-- is here.
So what's the problem?
You don't know me at all.
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
What?
Where to?
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Get back in the car!
The Pentagon.
How does that help me?
Well, if the bugs have hatched, and they're not here... then where are they?
in case I need it?
You coulda told me what you were doing.
Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
Are you sure you don't?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
What?
He won't.
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
What --
Somewhere.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
You set your patients on fire!
Drowning.
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
And who the hell is that?
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Run the subscription list...
Yes, it is.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
Do I know you?  Who are you?
I need your help.
I guess that's all of it.
No.  He got tired of pretending.
Sean --
I wanted to.
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
And how would I know that?
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
Hold that thought.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
I don't know who that is.
None of your damn business.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
There's thousands of units like this one.
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
Sure.  Raincheck.
I forgot my glasses.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
You mean after he lost your son.
What was it then?
What are you talking about?
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
He's alright.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
He's not doing it.
I want spaghettis.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
I feel weird asking him.
Go.
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
But what about them?
When's it going down?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Sure. Yeah.
This one?
Not driving Jess, you won't.
What?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Nah.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Ruiz isn't here.
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
Fuck them.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Sorry coach.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
Seat belt.
Pretty nice.
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
Great. On my fucking room.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You got something to say --
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English. 
What's up?
The penguin house.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
They only cover one fifty in incidentals. You've been ordering fucking... Motherfucker...
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
No more, man.
Let's just go now and wait.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
I didn't do anything --
He's on the list.
Cool. See you later.
Yes.
Where do you live?
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Nah, man...
You're from LA, right?
Tell me.
It's a digestif.
He has a cute what...?
A rose by any other name would --
He had it coming.
Bet you like that shit.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
What?
Bet you are.
Yeah.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
Where am I gonna start?
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
I want to. God knows I want to.
I admire your enthusiasm but you should never join any organization without first checking it out thoroughly.
Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
What?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
How do you like it?
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Hush your mouth.
What do you think?
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
We need you too!
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
Just what is your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?
Please, go ahead.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Sure, man.
If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
What mission?
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right?
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
[South America.]
We're interested in the same thing. I'm writing a story.
It's a little late.
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[We have an ATM bank card. We draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[No!]
[Don't lie to me.]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[I want you.]
[What do you mean?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
Show me, please.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
Who's Emilio?
I'm looking for potential.
No.
I go to school, don't I?
Where?
I dropped her at home.
I know you're not.
You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
Then don't come.
Camila. Camila Valencias.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
He has to go.
[A beautiful circle.]
I already ate.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You want me to ride down with you?
When was this?
I know it pains.
Yeah.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
Yes, I know.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
I'll wait for your call.
Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
Where you going now?
I'll see you around.
Oh, that's a sad story.
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
You gotta good heart.
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
Tomatoes.
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
Ma! Leave me alone!
Sure.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
What, Ma?
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Tommy...
You talked to Walt?
Which hospital?
No.  Or why you should.
Pour one for Painless.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
Perfectionist.
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
And gets the wind every time it opens. No, thanks. I'll take that one.
An application to Androscoggin College.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
Any time. Whenever we want.
I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
N-n-no thanks, G-General.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
Okay, but I'll need you to help. Duke, will you take that belly back there? The Australian?
Oh, Jesus.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Not necessarily.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
'The Last of the Mohicans.' Only book my father ever read.
It isn't always this rough?
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Yes, Reverend?
Let's get his clothes off quick.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Now?
Did you get it, too?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
Um-hum.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
John Doe, the one in the speech.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Uh-huh . . .
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Look, Johnwhat we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
Well, don't say anything at all. Just sit down.
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
Well, maybe you're right.
I got it all ready. Here.
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
That's
Where's Connell?
Baseball?
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Go out and find her!
Shut up!
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
You betcha.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
Whyuh
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
No, I didn't.
That's a lie! Listendon't believe what he says . . .
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Thanks.
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
What do you mean, too bad?
Racket? What do you mean?
How?
I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull.  Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me!
Deal.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
How can I help you with the particles?
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
What's the suspect's name?
Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
I have to go face to face.
I'll give you something.
SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
Is there something wrong with that?
I don't really like to drink.
You have to. It's a tradition.
Why? You like my ass?
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Pull up alongside.
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
Good question.
Only that floor.
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
If you did, you never showed it.
Ronnie...
And it's hard to get.
When?
It's very nice.
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
And you think he'll...
A deeper level?
...the hell are you talking about?
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
I want to be put on this case.
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
Yes.
About what?
That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
Then what?
So wrong --
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
It's his nature.
The woman you're stuck on.
There is no --
-- Who did he digitize?!
Who are you?!
But you were with me.
What's the difference?
Speed?
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!
SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
GO POWER RANGERS!
But ya got a Boss.
Charlie Luciano.
Got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. Nothin' you can do.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
Scared.
He was around...
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
The minute we sell out to Maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
I been thinkin'...
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
It'll just be a few minutes.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
You tryin' ta tell me something? I don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
He's trying to make it.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
And I got it all planned.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
I must know more of you, my son.
And the Jews?
That's why I'm here.
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
So change it.
There won't be any way to stay out of it.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
What?
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Bend over?
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
I might wake up.
I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
I'd better go report this...
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Have a nice day.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Aaron?
I'm sorry.
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
No!
Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
You got worms.
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
What do I play?
What dame?
Paine.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Drunks are funny--
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Diz--
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Where?
What?
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
We're waiting, Hubert.
How do you feel, champ?
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Oh! Go away.
Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If I throw Horace in their teeth now--
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Jeff for Senator.
Certainly. Step right in.
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Here--where are you running off to?
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
Yes, Ma?
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Try sitting down.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
He did?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
Letitia.
You--don't know it, do you?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Well, I guess it's a chance.
We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to more then one question at a time--
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Oh--you are!
Splendid.
That's--that's splendid.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
A Bill! Not *him*!
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
What's the matter?
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Go away, Nosey.
He's lost complete faith in me--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
Page boys!
Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
Who's that?
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Yes, you own it.
Any children?
Your Honor!
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
It's wonderful.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Now, what do you see?
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
What's that?
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
He did? I play the tuba
What did he play?
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
I don't blame you.
A girl?
Oh, hello darling.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Is he really that big a sap?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
I tell you that dame's nuts.
I wanna see that guy!
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
Yes.
How do you do.
How do you do.
All right.
You're going to New York with us.
No, thanks.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Huh?
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Thank you.  If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
They can have the Estate.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Uh-huh.
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds.  You know, we've got letters.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Thank you, Your Honor.
Uh-huh.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Uh-huh.
The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Prairie? Oysters?
You have no pants, sir.
Me, sir?
No!  What do you want!!
Really? You think so?
Were you supposed to have a session?
You're the shrink, aren't you?
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Right now?
Are we?
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
We've been talking about her, mostly.
Yes.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Got a license?  But no car?
Did you straighten her out?
That's right, the fake kind.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Maybe you'll catch it.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Uh-huh.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Disgusting.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
My brother said you were about to fire me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
You're upset.
I don't follow you.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Okay...
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
Hello.
You deserve it.
Will you think about it?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
What are you talking about?
Was it something that happened at school?
Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you.
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
That's all right. What's on your mind?
Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of --
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
What about everything? How did this happen?
Holy shit!
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
How'd you do it?  The new you.
Lily...  ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily.
Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked.
Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me?
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
Yeah! Them.
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Water turning to blood.
And what did he say?
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
No, I mean --
We're about to be shown the way.
Something like that.
I'm not?
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Right now, I only wish to join them.
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
Picked his pocket, actually.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
One last tweak.
What did he mean?
It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
They always call the great ones nuts.
You underestimate yourself.
Then why are you here?
Curiosity.
Remember the cat.
Me, too.
But I just don't feel it.
Are you coming or not?
Who's chicken? 
Or flowers.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Shhh.
No.
Anybody got any?
Hey... he's gone.
Really? Like Captain Amazing?
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
You did?
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
Through there!
My dear Caulaincourt, agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live.  Napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure England but, before that, he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live.  He cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring England to her knees -- and I'm afraid that is what it has come to.
My dear Caulaincourt, you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since Tilsit.  I am blamed by the army for the military disaster at Austerlitz and Friedland, by the nobility for ruining their trade with England, by the merchants who must accept French foods at unprofitable prices, and by the nation for allowing Napoleon to dictate Russian policy.
The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
Ah -- you approve?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Where are they?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
I wanted to kiss her, but she didn't want to kiss me... She slipped away, the moment I wanted to take her in my arms.
Let me see it.
No, sir, none at all.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
Four o'clock.
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
What is that?
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
Would you like some brandy?
Lisette La Croix.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
I know of no better time.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
I don't understand you.
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Yes!!
But you will not... be safe...
There's probably some explanation.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
Of course, my dear.
Yes, he has.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Is he alone?
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
That's it?
Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
Good.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
I'll do it.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.
Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Damn, you got a stalker.
That's the sister.
Still gonna smell it.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
What are you doing here?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
It's locked.
Okay.
Hold on.
Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
Come on.
Why did he go in the house?
I don't know.
He's a boy, dude.
I got fired too.
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
Get on!
I don't know the number.
Yeah, and hurry up.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Who did?
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
What?
Yes.
Keep your voice down.
What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
But...
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
Nods.
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.
I know you do, honey.
I promise.
All right. Kisses to you.
Keep it.
Please. Something is going to happen...
What? The end of the world? Man, don't give me your mad rap. I'm not a bartender. I don't want to hear it. I raise a family doing this bullshit. Do me a favor. Get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
What?
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Hi.
You're going to go see her.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
I see. Where is this gun?
A surprise?
Help me get her off the rug.
It's time. It's time now.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
'Daddy has to go now.
No.
You, Preacher?
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
I'll bet.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Dad, you're bleeding...
I been mindin' Pearl.
John: you go fetch Ruby.  Big Ruby's my problem girl. She can't gather eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?
Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
You don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
A man of the Cloth?
Tricked us!
What?
How?
What!
Blue men.
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
It'll spoil our supper.
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
I mind you said there was two.
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
What's that you're playing with, boy?
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
I'll tell.
Yes?
What secret shall I tell?
Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
O' course.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Ahh!
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
No, Harry! I thought --
I -- no, I --
Ruby, you didn't have no money to buy this.
This man down at the Drugstore...
I sure as hell hope so.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
It's nothing too hard or anything.  I'm just going to... LOOK for someone, and... I want you to be sort of a... guard. Okay?
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Yeah.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. That's why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
Krueger.
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Yes, Mother. G'night.
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Go on...
How the fuck do I know?  I don't expect you to believe me.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
It's from Paris.
Just for the honeymoon.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
That's right... and we might as well face it.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Go to bed.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
No, sir.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
I think she covered you with the parasites.
No, no.
Comrade.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
No.
Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
And where are we?
I'll try.
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Then you don't want me to go there.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
The bayonet? Did you really?
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
This is a place for workmen.
Must one always be after something?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
What, darling?
Darling, darling... please!
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
No! No!
But I can throw it out of the window.
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
I give them back to the people...  I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
So happy and so tired.
Those newspaper people?
No.
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
All right, I'll listen.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
I told you to go, madame.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
Thank you.
This will do. 
The future of the common people.
Where do you eat?
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
But sir, we'll have to start over from the beginning.  We don't have the staff to ...
Then what about this Washington Post crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?
We could get a million dollars.  We could get it in cash.  I know where it could be gotten.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
Is it?
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
For what?!
Your lawyers feel it's the ... "smoking gun."
That's right ...
That smell.  I mean, everybody suffered so much, their sons killed. They need to sacrifice something, y'know, appease the gods of war -- Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood, General.  I am that sacrifice, in the highest place of all ... All leaders must finally be sacrificed.
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
Because the President says it is.  My job is to protect this country from its enemies, and its enemies are inside the walls.
The bastard!  If I'd called his shot on Cuba I would've won.  He made me look soft.
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
Why would they?!  Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway?  Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things.  They come to Jew York City and they buy up things.  One of the things they buy is the New York Times.  And you know what?  Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American.
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
The President would support a reasonable request for an increase.
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can assure you.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
Winning?
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
The White House.
You're fucking me.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Personally, I'll be calling the President of the United States.
Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ...
We'll see about that.
He's all business, ain't he, Trini?  Dick, we could've had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal.  We brought you down here 'cause we wanted to talk to you ...
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
I was the lesser of two evils.
But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't lied about knowing Chambers.  The documents were old and out of date, like these Pentagon Papers.  The key thing we proved was that Hiss was a liar.  Then people bought it that he was a spy.  It's the lie that gets you.
You're the one who should be in politics, John.  You're tougher than I am.  You never crack.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
Mr. Nixon.
Syracuse.
Ernie Davis.
POWs.  And their families.
Yes, yes.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
I'll never run again.  I promise.
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
Do you really want this, Dick?
Then I'll be there for you.
Are you okay?
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
You're a long way from Whittier.
You.  What' you're doing --
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
Don't be ridiculous!
There'll be time for that.
Well enough.  You're looking "happy," Nelson.
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
Who else'd be in your truck.
How's that?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Nothin'?
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
Yessir. But then there's this other. He nods up the ridge away from the highway.
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.
Mm.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
Don't get hurt.
Okay.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
It's full a money.
At the gettin' place.
Llewelyn!
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Not any more, Carla Jean. You're retired.
Where does he work?
Step out of the car please, sir.
You from around here?
Yeah? Where am I?
Yes.
You already asked me that.
Yes I do.
Yes.
Just call it.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
That's twenty-six dollars.
Okay.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
Then you'll like me.
How would you describe him?
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
Yes.
No. You don't.
I don't know. American citizens.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
Nam?
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
Great. Good. Content...
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Umm... yes. Back home.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
All the time...
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
I gotta go.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
Yes, she is.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Did you love it?
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
Like Rome?
You made out alright.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
Man, that is love.
No, that's not, I couldn't...
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
I was talking about what you could wear!
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
No, that should be more than --
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
No...
Like what?
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
My socks?
Hell of a way to die.
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.  Never abandon you instincts.
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
Joyce was screwing Del.
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
Half.
What?
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
Hmm... you two in high school together?
Aren't you a sweetheart... no, not quite. Anyway, she's been with us awhile.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
I'll think about it.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
I said I'll think about it.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
So tell her to settle for the old one in Orange County.
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
I swear to God!
You mis'able little sneak thief...
Good Lord, what do we do?
And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license.
Oh Lord yes, any parish'r precinct; I was makin' the larger point.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Suckin' away.
Devil his due.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Now Penny, stop that!
You said -
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway.  And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
Million point two.
Well, but Pete...
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys?
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Why?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Yeah, I know.
A long time ago.
I don't mean anything by it.
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
Pity you don't have the character.
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Then, I'll see you around.
I got my foot on the floor.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
But in what ways?
That's it?
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
I don't want you to move.
When I'm good and ready.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
There is not one thing funny here.
Remember that.
Two.  Squeeze harder.
I don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
Get the fuck away from me.
You're an idiot.
This is insane.  I'm outta here.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Hey.
Adios.
I don't get it.
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
And with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
What do they want?
Feel okay?
Fuck.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
I don't know, why?
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Yes, no, I don't know, do 'em all!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
He won't even know who it was.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
Yeah... whatever you say.
Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Look this is bull...
Inside ain't in the system.  It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Can you make a deal with them?
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Jesus...
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
Yes, that's exactly what I mean. And Agent Rodgers?... This conversation never occurred.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
A gun's a gun man. It don't need to be loaded.
So what's the deal?
You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
Bullshit...
Look... You... take her and get the hell out of here. I'll keep 'em busy.
Not at all.  I'll catch you later.
Where is he?.
Why didn't you tell me?
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
What unit?
My pleasure, sir.
Thank you.  How's the spotted one's milk?
I have no choice, I...
Is that so?
Father?
I should have killed him when I had the chance?
What?
Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
You said bribery twice...
How many men have we seen die?
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
I've had no sons to lose, nor daughters.  I lose the sons of other men.
But father, they might come this way.
Thank you.  Did you finish the upper field?
Ayuh.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Well, I thought it was safe--
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
What?
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
You're telling me.
Don't worry about that.
Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
Aye, aye, sir!
That's right.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
All right then.
Did you, now?
Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
Then why aren't you eating?
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
Yes -- yes.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Nor did you, I noticed.
Exactly.
What's your plan?
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Agreed!
We need to go!
Aye!  Avast!
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
It's the right way.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Yes.
No.
No.  She hasn't.
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Please.
No.  The captain of the containment crew is closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
I look behind us, I look to the past, to a world steeped in rot and decay.  I think of the Acropolis in another century reduced to little more than dust.  I see the faces of Rushmore eventually losing all distinction, and then I look at this...
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
If you honestly trust me, then you'll have to trust me.
Considering what?
You better quit pushing me, pal.
I'll do whatever I have to do.
That's the guy?
Well, you got another problem.
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
Like Crazy Glue?
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
No, no, I just feel wired!
What?  What's wrong?
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
I remember I was trying to help...
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
That's right.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Goodbye, Stew
No - give you another guess.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
You're acting like a child.
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husbandHe has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
Why
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Yeah, hello. How are you?
We were classmates.
Oh yeah?
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
A photograph? What's the matter? Hasn't mama had you done in oils yet?  "Just A Gigolo . . . "
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Gloria Golden?
Do you call yourself a reporter?
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
My play.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
But not for me!  Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
Now Mr. Smith, now please
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
and those and them.
I hope you'll be very happy.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
My mistake - she's glaring.
Okay.
Been where?
What did he want?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
You quit trying to stop anybody
All right, Grandma
I beg your pardon?
I understand, sir.
Yeah.
Found no skeletons?
It's haunted just the same.
Well, sir, I putter.
I just putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well sir, I'll show you.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
That's all I wanted to know!
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
Yes.
Well ...  ... Your father would never do anything like that.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
In my handbag.
And they won't be able to tell?
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
Sure you are.
Where are you gonna go?
But where would we go?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
No it couldn't!
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
No it isn't.
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
I thought the books were blank?
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
You--you gotta get us out of here.
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
It's fine.
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Well ... I just ...  Can I ask you a question?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Oh ... Hi.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
What's that like?
Hunh?
Rain.
We'll just put up the top.
Because we don't belong!
But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Re-runs?
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Oh--well ...
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
Look ...
No you're not.
This is TV pal. They don't fool around.
Oh.
You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
... What's that?
Open it.
Just a little--You know.
Yeah. TV busted?
Well, I can't talk though --
And what was this?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
Please don't.
I....please don't do this.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
Are your pants off?
...yes...
You sound very cute, very nice.
No.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Yes.
Can I ask you a question?
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
-- you said you did.
They don't get opened until eight.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Thank you.
Ok.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
Sure.
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
....No....
Yes.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
Really?
Yeah.
It's Barry.
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
This is nice.
For what?
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
That's right you travel so much.
It's ok to ask that.
What is this?
Ok, bye, bye.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
......and this is confidential?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
What's that for?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
I'll say whatever I want --
I didn't know you had a sister?
How's business?
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
It takes time to process --
Hey...Lance....can I.....
You're goin' on a trip?
...I'll tell you later.
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Let's just figure that out later --  Ok. I gotta go. I'm just gonna go now and I'll call you from there, you're in charge 'till I get back. And don't tell my sisters anything? He exits.
Please don't do this.
Yes. Sorry.
I know.
I thought Latisha said you would --
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
It's not bad, it's ok.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
He did seem a little strange.
Yes, Abbe?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
Enough to discern its tenor.
And --?
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Do I have your word?
We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
A man after my own heart...
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
-- that was lust --
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
You're a sentimental man.
HER NAME, ABBE.
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben. Mine is a higher mission.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Come now, darling, give it a read.
Now's not the time to be cheeky, Maddy.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
I can't
And he did.
Yeah
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
I will not defend my life to you--
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
There's a different between want and
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
You are talking to him.
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Don't do this
I don't have it anymore?!
NOT UNLESS I. TELL YOU IT IS
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
The title?
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Get out
Again
Please don't ask me to do this.
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Yeah.
For what?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
You want the title shot or not?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
Well, that's what I mean.
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
What?
Whatsa matter with you?
Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie.
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
Should I hit it?
Just give it a nice little tap.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Who asked you?
Who asked you?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
I never noticed his face.
You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
What did I do?
You're hurting my arm.
Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
Jake --
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
OK. Talk.
Aw, c'mon, Vick --
Are you drunk?
Never felt better.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
No, you're his wife.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Name me a better photographer.
But his leg!
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
For instance?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
A detective's nightmare.
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
This is Doyle, Jeff.
I told you that --
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
No.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
I'll have him call the moment I hear from him.
Who's Thorwald?
Empty as a football.
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
For what?
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
Three.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
Nothing, thank heaven.
What is it you're looking for?
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
But you're not?
How?
Jim Stark.
Buzz Gundersen.
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
I still think you should go down.
Stay here.  That was my son!
Yes, sir.
Where did you get the gun?
What?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Come out come out wherever you are!
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
Come on!
Who?
Why?
Sure I'm sure.  Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
And you wanted him to make a list!
What's that got to do with it?
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
So then you moved?
Pretty mixed up?
Just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
Who lives?
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
See, we're very modern.
I don't know.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
We were romantic then too--
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
We're talking, aren't we?
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
You are to me.
Beauty and fragrances.
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
I love you!
No!
Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
I saved you because I love you, Nick.  Why'd you save me?
What?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
Put him in the truck.
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
So you could get with my sister.
Where'd she drop her cherry?
You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is.  We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how.
I said, who the hell made the map?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers.
Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move.
I don't know... what you're...
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?!
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
What?
Yeah.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
Oh.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Good for you. Protein.
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
You gave them me.
What? No...
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you. I don't really care about what you know or don't know. I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, I've heard it all before. There's nothing you can do. Except pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Where was she from, Compton?
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
What?
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
Did the two of you talk?
The Brewers.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
Dead as Dillinger.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
That's your proof?
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
He don't believe in it.
You do?
Freddy Newendyke.
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us once, about five months ago.
Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
Why not?
Uh-uh, just cops.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
You takin' his side?
This is what he was doin'.
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
They're stragglin'.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
That's fine.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
How's that?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
In a fight?
That's right, Steve.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Sure. What other reason would there be?
All right, you didn't know.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
I suppose that's your wagon in the river.
Yeah.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Don't you even know your letters?
I sure would.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
You sure?
No. I never date outside my race.
Okay. See you later, friend.
Open chest!!!
Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me?
Hugh Kane.
Great!!!
No. Keep rubbing.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
My child, you're alive!
You could use the grade, huh?
Yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
I wouldn't go that far.
Professor!
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
I think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
Yours, or the turkeys?
Father, come in, please.
Because she will lie?
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
MURDERED?!!
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
Let me see!
But Mom, the video's not over.
Oh Mom...
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Doesn't threaten me, honey. I'm happy.
I can't believe I thought my own mother was a murderess!
That's nice.
Nice?! He should have been executed!
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
I've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the Eastern Shore.
Don't wake the kids...
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
It was her! Beverly Sutphin! Sittin' right there!  I'm lucky I'm not DEAD!!
I do, please.
Always something isn't it?  Can I help you?
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
Sure I do.
No.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
As a man, you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician.
How much have you got?
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
But I like teaching school.
What did she want to know?
Yes.
I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
Goodnight, Mary.
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
Who the devil is he?
But I'm not joking.
Not from me.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
And then?
Yes. I was going to tell you to look into your own heart -- do you really want to find your sister?
Devil worshippers!
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you - you're off to work.
Bella Romari	If I were not seated, I would embrace you in three movements like a sonata.  Ah, my wonderful one. Fly with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the gypsies.
She was my patient.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
After that wonderful first book - after all the adulation and the good reviews?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
I'd forgotten.
Yes. When I tell you.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
It might have.
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
I haven't said anything of the sort.
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
Thank you, my dear.
I'll be out in a minute.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Yes?
I used to take great pleasure in that, being purposefully different, rubbing people's noses in it. Didn't you do that when you were younger?
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Hmm. Well, maybe you are. Really, I wouldn't pay much attention.
Agreed.
You're in therapy?
Of course not.
All of these are interviews?
You just ask them questions?
Yes.
Why didn't you tell me?
I have money.
Yes.
Do you want me to stop?
Yes.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
You said you weren't always impotent.
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
I've told you.
Like maybe a big part?
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
But I'm not.
I want out of this marriage.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Yes.
That you are under no obligation to me?
Yes.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
Apparently.
I wanted him to see me.
You don't know that for sure.
I can't believe you did that!!
I feel like I do.
Did you take your clothes off?
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
Nope.
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
What do you get?
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
He doesn't have to tell me.
Okay.
Maybe.
You are scum. I'll be there.
I want to see you.
I like the way he dresses.
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
Who?
Graham.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
What do you mean?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
What tapes?
So is my wife, asshole!!
I'm not going to give you my keys.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
Yes?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
He said immediately.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
Do I get a kiss?
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
He needs help.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
...closed?
Yes, Betty.
It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
Could you tell us a little about it?
Of course.
What show?
Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
F for...
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
No.
We're not confused.
We love you, Baby.
I love you.
How's the trip?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
So I guess that's it.
What are you pouring tonight?
I could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend. Could have made a pork roast.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Me too.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Just a minute!
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
You know her?
Sure I know Maya.
She is very hot.
Perfect.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
You have the keys.
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you?  Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Yeah. Okay.
With this chick.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Look who's talking. You've been there.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
Huh. Let me think.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
You're joking, right?  What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Hrnrnrn?
No, I'm okay.
I'll pay for it.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Good for you.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
"The Day After Yesterday."
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
I had class.
You too.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
I am.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Hi baby.
I don't feel much.
...I will.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
Curse and stuff.
Just make noises then.
I got him.
They're right behind the door.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
It needs batteries.
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Why not?
What book!
My partner and me robbed the bank in Turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. My partner there caught one a ways back, and I think he kicked off while I was looking for this damn canyon. You're Dawson, ain't you? I'm Tex LaRue.  Used to ride with Ry Morris. You know him. Well, Andy Sims told me there was a hideout here, so I headed for it. Hope you don't mind.
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
Sounds good.
Some. I've been talking to the Parkers. One thing I know I'm not doing -- I'm not going back.
Just like you'd think. But he's not going to run. We're sticking to our plan. Now we both need help.
That I do.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
And you're not Baxter, either?
I haven't done anything.
Not for five years.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
All right, you buy me a drink.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
We didn't get that far.
That's what you said in Turley. You remember how that ended.
Is that a fact?
We'd rather stay.
You're kidding.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Daddy's dead.
What makes you think I could?
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
You don't know?
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
Maybe you could run it without Stella.
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
Good-bye, Paden.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
Who?
I am telling the truth.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
The picture's dead.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
Why not?
She'll drive herself.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Simone does not control my destiny.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
You're so good to protect her like this.
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
I just read somewhere --
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
How much wine have you had?
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Simone?
Is that a problem?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
You never were together, Hal.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
"Straw God" changed my life.
You saw that?
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
Hello, Lainey.
No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
I love you too, daddy.
I know.  Thank her for me.
Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Abduction?
Don't you?
Why?
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Taller?  What?
Yes, I'd like that.
Thank you.
You could play the lead.
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
A star is...
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
I am the death of real.
Tell me.
Words.
Yes.
What do you want more than anything?
I don't know, Cole.
When?
Yes, I am.
You believe now?
--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
How'd he know I'd come?
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Hey. Fuck you.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Metaphysical question, man.
Come out, come out wherever you are!
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
Nah. Just you.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
What are --
It's you. You and your father.
Suzie --
What'll we do?
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
That wasn't a good night, no.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
How much style?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Having fun.
Seriously?!?
You just passed your nemesis.
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
Bandit II?
What kind of a guy is he?
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
Absolutely.
Another time.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Save it. We got a long haul.
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Go head on, breaker.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
How's your twenty?
-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
Of course. Yes.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Mortal.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
But there were more of you?
No, what did you say on the machine?
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
-- You can and you will.
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
...He does now...
...So you knew all this and yet y--
You got clicks, anything?
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
What!?
Fuck you.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
...What are they doin' right now...?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
Not her.  It.
No, she won't.
You fucking bastard...
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
She was real.  Where did she come from?
Told you what?
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
I'll go with you.
Yes.
You didn't look very happy.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
But that's what happened before.
He is.  But he was here...
Don't call me that.
I'm disgusting.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
You were reading my Renoir.
Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I follow.
And "is"...?
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
Let go!
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Yeah.
I know.
... Don't explain.
Yeah...
I don't know...
You take care.
Just putting in an appearance then.
... I don't want to talk about it...
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
Claire...
Nothing.
Too kinky.
Your what...?
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Why?
You talked to his wife?
Even Joey Venza?!
Why should she come in?
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
Don't you fuckin' give orders to me...
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Shooting.
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
You stop him?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways, I was never much for, ya know, discipline.
No, no.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Or was it all a dream?
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
I'm here...
I'm a photographer, remember?
Yes.  Do you have a date?
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
Really, Professor, I--
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Static!
Roger.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Stop it, Harry!
You want Betty Grable!
Let me go!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
Let go, Animal! It's chow! We'll miss chow!
It's not good for you, Animal.
Do Jimmy Durante!
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
It's that song, Harry!
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Yes, sir.
The guy I want to talk to is Sefton. Where's Sefton?  You haven't seen Sefton, have you?
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Says me.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
We did it.
Right.
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
The one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Always joking. Always making wisecrackers!
That is my wife.
Come on, let's get that mail. Anything for Stanislaus Kuzawa?
Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Wherever he wanted to be.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Ever since I was a little boy, I remember hearing about the family line. The Picards that fought at Trafalgar, the Picards that settled the first Martian colony. When my brother married and had a son...
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
Aye, sir.
Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
I went wrong.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
Logic indicates that is the case.
I still don't...
Request permission to beam aboard immediately.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
The <u>doors</u>, Mr. Scott!
Just him, sir!
What? What are you saying?
The ship... Out of danger...?
I'll need it, Sulu.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Close... There --
Come on!
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Report status!
Torpedoes coming in -- !
Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
I -- saw no future --
Yes...
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Exactly. Happy birthday.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
... Can't read you... repeat...
... Please help us, Jim... won't let them have... without proper... repeat... on whose authority...
Mother, go back!
I suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix...
I saw it -- !
Never mind! Hurry!
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
Is that what you came here to say?
Don't you believe it.
Locking phasers on target.
Inoperative.
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Do it, while we have time.
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
I am understandably curious.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
Aye sir --
I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
... No, sir. It has not.
Aye, sir.
Aft thrusters, sir.
Ready, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Aye, sir.
By the book...
And finally, they're not human beings, you know. Their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours --
Why don't I?
-- That's the general idea.
A joke is a story with a humorous climax.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
... My God...
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
Can you isolate the wave?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way.
I buy that. What about him?
We don't want to be any trouble.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
Who do you think I am?
All right. The truth?
I'm all ears.
That's what you think.  Okay...Truth... I'm from what, on your calendar, would be the late 23rd Century. I've been sent back in time to bring two Humpback Whales with me in an attempt to... repopulate the species.
You want the details?
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Here... In the park?
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Kirk. They're gone.
You mean this is -- goodbye?
The late 20th Century.
Simple logic will suffice. We need a map.  That one should do.
I see.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
Admiral, you'll be trapped!
You will be in good hands here.
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
Of course.
Right on. You fly?
I don't like to leave questions unanswered.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
I just... haven't gotten around to it yet.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
I aspire to be more than I am.
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
And our people?
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Safer than leaving her here.
And I do not believe I made a very good first impression.
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
What kind of concerns?
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs.
Deploy the collector.
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
They... are in opposite directions, sir...
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Remind me to lodge a protest...
We're through running from these bastards.
Ask them.
I'm afraid there's too much bitterness... on both sides.
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
I'm not letting go of him.
No, sir...
Gorch?
Picard to Crusher...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
No children?
Whatever makes you comfortable...
... I believe you...
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
Not yet.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
I believe so.
Where's the Sphere?
Today is March second, 2063. The time in Montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
We're crossing the threshold!
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Main bus...
Jean-Luc Picard.
These people you're calling "Vulcans"... who are they? Where do they come from? How many troops? What kind of weapons?
Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up.
I'm very sorry.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
Why?
Aye, sir.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Go to manual.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
Agreed. Options?
Just a little queasy...
Admiral Donald...Bill...
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
Can you - ?
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
No way.  You see this?
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
And perhaps with a large step or two. Like a peace treaty.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
I checked the data banks, yes.
That isn't true...!
You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
I know what you mean...
Shields up, Captain --?
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
I like it here...
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Captain, if --
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a Court Martial on this ship, Lieutenant. Win, lose or draw it will be on your record.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
Where?
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
Gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else - another kin of life. People can be very frightened of change. I know I was.
An error.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Sir?
Negative. The subspace shockwave originated at bearing three-two- three, mark seven-five, the location is...  Praxis. A Klingon moon. Barren of indigenous life forms but -
Essential as a resource. Praxis is their key energy production facility.  Send to Klingon High Command: "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship traveling through Beta Quadrant. We have monitored a large explosion in your sector. Do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
Why?
Why?
I do not understand.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
He turned out all right.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
You do not look like me.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Why is it moving?
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
Thank you.
What do we know about the population?
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
With or without the rest of the fleet?
Just lucky, Admiral.
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
Thank you, sir...
No?
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Unity, Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
What happened?
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Looking up at the stars.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Its too late.
What about Picard?
Runs in the family.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
You heard me.
Now go. I have some personal business.
I don't think so... 
We should have. Let me see.
No.
Elmo's...
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
No, we don't.
Watch it. They're coming out.
Get a highway patrol unit over there.
Don't... don't do this... please...
This car runs on gas.
Shit?
You didn't even see it.
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
I do not speak English.
Please stay.
What?
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I feel better if I move.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
You're damn right I am.
It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
What will you say about us?
Many, many days and nights...
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
In the cars, too?!
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Twenty-eight years.
I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
You saw that?
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Take her up to the suite.  Have a glass of champagne... or six... I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.
What're you going to do?
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
That's a good one, coming from you.
Damn right.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
I'm on her.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
No.  Bad idea.
Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
Where's Faith?
I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
Just those two loose-cannon cops running around covering their butts.
Sorry.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
Jesus, Lenny.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
Fire's out, isn't it?
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
I'm not going.
I guess.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Yeah, right.  Fucked.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Anybody talk to the press?
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
I'm on my way.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Hi. What's in the case?
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
What kind?
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
At the field office.
This better be important.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
Do you think he singled you out?
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
Collected shoes too?
There was talk of a file photo.
As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
How long have you been downtown?
They're all criminals?
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
And one other thing.
What's this country coming to?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
And you're working with him?
Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
When you exit, head east on 10th.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
Who told you about her?
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
I want to go live with you.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
No. Stop, come on.
Shut up.
I'd say about two weeks.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
Yeah.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
...you might get cut out.
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
Sorry?
You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
Why not?
Why not?
It's a rebound.
Six years.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...Which one...?
I can call back...
That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
...Six months.
Right.
Unless she comes back first.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
Oh, like that song...
Give me the money. I'll get it.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Wow, I guess you were home... 
What are you talking about? Vegas?
Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
You think they're watching?
Let's go.
Who's the big winner?
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
She likes you.
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
Baby, you did fine.
No! Not the camera guy!
She didn't like me, anyway.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
Don't remind me.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
A day.
...Is he brown?
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
That's what I keep trying to tell him.  You're so money, you don't even know...
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...just be smart about it.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Sure.
When did he call?
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
What else do you believe in?
How?
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
You want him to stay in this country.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
Don Tommassino...I should see this place.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Okay.  One minute.
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
How will they come at you?
I told you you wouldn't like him.
My brother, Tom Hagen.
Sure.
No.
I love you.
I don't think so either.  I better go.
Goodbye.
Let HER ask.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
He won't be; I swear to you be my children he won't be.  Just keep an open mind when we talk.  I hope you're not a hothead like your brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to talk business with him.
I do wish to be baptized.
You think I scam?
Do you recognize my voice?
Shut up!
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
Bird!
I didn't mean with you in it.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it.
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
Really? To Italy?
Aye, aye.
Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois.
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
Thanks, yes, I think we did.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Dickie?
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Shut up! Shut up!
What are you going to do now, Tom?
What?
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
It's okay.
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
That's good, isn't it?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
Or I could come back.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
Peter, I... I...
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
You have, yes.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Yes, mam.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
That's really something.
The DMZ?
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
Oh. Who was that again?
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
My God!
Keep it.
You forgot "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
Have you been noticing anything strange?
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
What did you do?
Yeah.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me. 
Where.
Easy.
What's your real name?
You can do it in my mouth.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
That's not hard to do.
Where is home?
Pittsburgh.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
Besides, I've got to stay here.
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
No Sir.
So why do you want to be a taxi driver?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Education?
Honorable discharge. May 1971.
No, I want long shifts.
Anything you say, officer.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Yeah?
The taxi life, you mean.
Travis, look, I dig it. Let me explain. You choose a certain way of life. You live it. It becomes what you are. I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab. I guess that's the way I want it.  You see, that must be what I am.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
You suppose?
An F.B.I. Man asking me for a break. How droll.
Hi.
I am, too.
Dad... 
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
That's... pretty frightening.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Start with what you knew then.
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth.
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
You bet.
You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Anybody take it?
Pete...
We live in a theater?
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
Thirty a month.
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt.  You know me, I'm non- political.  Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
You should watch what you say.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
It's wrong, Leo.
No thanks.
Not at all.
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Cat.
They will.  They w-w-will.
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
Yes, I did.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
Different?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Then what was it?
Because she was afraid.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I see.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Don't you like us?
I think they'll be all right, honey.
It's Alice, ain't it?
It's Alice.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
And the white house?
The two kids?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
Mmmm.
Okay.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
I hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack. Their brain pans aren't large enough for such...
Birds are not bad!
Young woman cut herself.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
I don't know.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
Oh.
Lovebirds, sir?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
When?
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
What are you? A policeman?
I think you're a louse.
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
How do you know Annie?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
I do different things on different days.
I'm glad you do.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Hear, hear!
With my little sparrow leading team.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
Melanie...
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
How long have they been gathering there?
Have we still got power?
Santa Rosa?
Maybe.
You said three o'clock.
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
They are incapable of organized warfare!
Put on your coats! Do you want to get trapped here?
How could I?  I will do my best. After all, you see, I am financially interested.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Ask this one favor --
I've heard of it.
No.
The little girl -- she couldn't walk far -- the muscles are too weak -- but she did stand and she took a step or two.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
A doctor?
I'll not do it, Gray.
No.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
The heart pumps it.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
You are not to set foot in here again, Gray, for business or any other reason. And you're going out now!
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
You can get out.
Yeah. I sure will.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Good thing in a situation like this.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
No. You don't.
So you're going to kill him?
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
It's not. I can't take it.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
He's looking for something. Won't stop until he finds it.  Sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
Give me a hand with this sack of shit.
Honey. I just can't.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
Looks like you have them both on.
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
That was my first question.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Honest, Mom, I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
Mr. Brady's a cop.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Goodnight.
How does he explain that?
You must have come a long way.
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
Where is the meeting going to be?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
He's a vampire alright.
Two down and two to go.
That's right.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
I will, David!
No, Star.  Put it down.  Put it down.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
There's a cop behind us.
Sam, don't --
Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
I better get cleaned up, then.
Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
For everything.
We are...
We can't talk about it on the phone.
Sorry, Mom.  It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window.  I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away...
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
-- a job.
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
Well, I...
Me, too.
Now you and David...
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
Even poor people have T.V.s
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
Don't turn on the light.
Huh?...
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
So what's our problem?
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Clark, you come on out here!!
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
How the fuck do I know?!
He's gone already!  Do it!
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
Now Copper, you tie Palmer up.
Maybe we shouldn't.
If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.  You play chess?
So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
Well, get to it.
A day or so ago... I guess.
'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
No.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
I ain't going with Sanchez.
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
Chance we got to take.  We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
Get your gear on.
MacReady, that you?
I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.
No...
But there's nothing here.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
Yes...
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
I'm a foolish man.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Why is it -- breaking up?
You know I can't.
You promised me flowers tonight, don't you even remember?
Sorry... I was distracted.
You know I can't.
All right...
All right...
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
Nothing.
I care more about my life.  And yours.
I know that --
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
His home.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
What makes you say that?
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
What's it all for?
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Did you have fires at night?
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Here?
Might I ask why?
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
New Yorkers.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
What do you mean?!
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
Kalen...
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
That's quite enough, Kalen.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
No, we were patients.
Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
Then, where are you going?
I'm doing fine.
You're not crazy.
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
This has nothing to do with that.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
Well, what time is it?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
What are you talking about?
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Sure.
[Beat] I do it.
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
Why?
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
I'm a robber.
What?
A regular outlaw.
Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
Okay.  I'll call you back.  In an hour.  Don't tell Darryl.
Who did it?
What?
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Am I in trouble?
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Which part?
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
I don't know.  I won't be.
Louise.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
He's a real piece o' work.  I wish you could meet him.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
What for?
Why not?!  What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is.  Shit!
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Suck my dick... Boom!!
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
It'd have to be pretty good.
We've gone insane.
Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
Where?!
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee.
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Nah.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
I mean since then.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
I don't know what to say.
Got cash.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Oh come on, why would I lie?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Relax, he just ate.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
No thanks.
Pat Healy.
I work with retards.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Well, I know you're busy...
You don't buy what?
You want her dead, don't you?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Four kids, three different guys.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Why you son of a --
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
Oh come off it, Mare. What about what's-his-name... Steverino? You could've at least passed the baton on that one.
Ah, she's okay.
Good lookin'?
Healy.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
Hi, Mary.
Are you all right?
And did everything -- ?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
I agree there should be more.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
All right, let's go.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Okay.
You forgot your keys!
I wish.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs. Put Nitze, Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge.
Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.
And, of course, the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast.
Yes, sir. Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational. The invasion happens eight days later.
General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
Deal.
What about you? Where are you going?
No you weren't.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
Damn right I'm scared.
Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right.
Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me.
Jesus Christ...
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Just a second, Mr. President.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
Again. Figures, man.
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
Seven.
No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
You weren't sent here to go off on your own detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit. These regional agents are inept -- that's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not pulling against me.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
He also said "listen to the water."
I don't see the connection.
Cuz you're a cop.
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Well, it was just a dream, I --
Nothin'. Forget it.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
Good.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
How so?
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Yeow!
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
It's classified.
What are you talking about?
How about anything, anything you want to do.
I'm starting to sense that now.
It's not suffering anymore.
About as much as they think about killing me.
Where?
You want to go ballistic?
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
I know exactly what you mean.
Well what?
F-14's sir.
Remember one thing.
What is?
You're crazy. We're level.
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
You go. I'm staying with it.
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
The plane is fine.
Is it you?
Well what?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
They should have warned you about that one.
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
Thirty seconds. That's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
That's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. It was great.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
You saved our lives. You did it!
We did it.
Who is the best.
Nope.
Need a hint?
I've seen this before.
What the hell you doing?
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
Yes sir.
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
Or....
Not something they tell dependents.
Take me to the hotel.
How'd you find me?
Not true, he's one of my best friends...He's got a big house and a Mercedes.  And you like Melina, right?  Well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--That's right.  She's gonna be Hauser's babe.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
Forty-one A, Ernie.
Any news of Quaid?
O.K., everybody pull out!
Yeah.
Let me buy you a drink.
Come on, let's go have that drink.
What the hell is this?
How did I get in this taxi?!
Mmmm.....
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
--I got a trip to Mars.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
It was implanted by the Agency.
Yeah.  Some of it was fun.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
What are you talking about?
This is too weird.
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
Ready as we'll ever be.
My cannon.
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
The new one!  That's supposed to be a girl!
...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
I'll go with that plan.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
We got a plan!
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
What?
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah, Heather, we got you.
Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
It's...gone...!
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
Yeah, good!  Something to keep them busy.  We need a decoy.
An hour after you picked it up!
And one good guy.
True.
Absolutely.
In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong!
What about entrapment?
Not necessarily...
You fucking swear to shut up!
With two knives taped to his hands? Forget it, Rog.
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
That's why I hate experts.
I followed her from the courthouse.
"Painted"?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
What went down?
It was self-defense.
Jimmy Chin? Was that self-defense too?
See-cil.
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
-- alleged crime --
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
For control of the prison drug trade?
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
You mean to say Mr. Kim told you that he murdered Jimmy Chin?
Tell me some other things about her.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
What was?
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
Well, where are you going?
An old woman and her grandson.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
OK, Gordon.
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
No.
Did she ever mention any friends?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
I haven't got it yet.
But Bob isn't real.
Oh, yes... yes...
Did you make me a tape?
I am The Muffin.
We're on our way, Baby.
Everything, but everything.
Sex?
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
I forgot my books at school.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
Good night, sweetheart.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
I was down the street.
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Bobby didn't give you this?
Nothing, I chickened out.
As if I didn't know.
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
Nothing.
The man's an ambulance chaser...
No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
I wouldn't do it.
No.
I do. Yes.
I'm just an M.D.
Through, through his book.
Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
You may step down.
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Well, many reasons, actually...
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
Tell us.
...that's all right.
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
...What difference would...
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Do you know who her doctors were?
Hi. How are you doing?
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
Yes.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Are you done?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
It's over!
Mr. Alito, please.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
How come you're calling me from...?
This is Miss Costello...?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to...
I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
It's a long road that has no turning.
Sally Doneghy, now who is that?
They still have to take it to a jury.
Today is Tuesday. What?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
What did she do?
She did?
Yes, the roving nurse...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Me, too.
We'd be in all the papers!
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Did it do you any good?
Where are we?
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
We're right in a nest of 'em! ... I've got to get a look at them.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
I should survive two days in Palmdale supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don't you think?
Chase. Hi...
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
Say how they find their way back home.
They were safe and could sleep.
The mean old man with the claws.
Your bed?
Under my covers.  Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
That's right.  So I won't be long. Meanwhile Julie's gonna be right here with you.
A story?
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Coffee'd be nice.
Your father?
You miss him.
He has a lot of hurt inside him.
Claiming their place in the world.
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Yes sir.
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
Wanna bet?  Takes me half a day to get through one chapter of Lawford and I still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  You know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because I can't spell.  While everybody else is sleeping, I'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
We all have problems.
Look, I just better go.
Fine.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
Do what?
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
Speak up boy!
Unfurl the squares!
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
Oh, really?
I'm sorry, Skip.  It's this damned book.  Lawford gave it to me.
A padlock.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
Look, save it for somebody else will ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
You know what he is talking about here?
What is it... the secret?
What's that?
Sir.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
How ya feelin', Artie? I heard you wasn't doin' too well recent.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
Fuck me.
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
You an indian?
Whattaya mean family?
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
No shit?!?! You know him?
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Muchas gracias.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.
You ain't actin', mama.
Thinkin' a second, baby.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
We'll find out in a hurry.
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
They have, sugar.
It's a comfortin' idea.
If you say so.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
And Bobby too, I hear...
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
What makes sense, is all.
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Have it your way... But you want it.
What do you want me to do about it?
Take care of him?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Yes.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
No... But...
Santos... I can't...
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
What?
Where we goin'?
Well, she wants to fuck you.
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Life is unpredictable.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
It's a little late to call Admissions.
Which is?
So sensitive.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Don't touch it.
So whose car is it?
I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Do you know he won't expel him?
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
Grady, it's Sara. Thank God you're there. You won't believe what's happened.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
You're in Kinship?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
...You carry firearms.
Like the lady herself.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
I had to. Didn't I?
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
But... ?
Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
How did I get here last night?
So where have you been staying?
The bus station.
Who?
Jesus, James. Wow.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
Kinship.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
What?
Jealous? Of me?
Not you. Your talent.
I never said that.
Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead.
Just checking.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Grady!
That good, huh?
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Nothing. I think I twisted my --
You got me.
I'm kidding. Hello?
About the baby.
What's he doing out there?
I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my --
I said it didn't sound like you.
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
Why yes. How did you know?
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
It's Grady, Walter.
This is important.
Thanks -- Whoa, Professor Tripp, careful here...
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
I might have his number on campus.
You want to keep him happy.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
This little table is one heavy bitch.
Then what? What?!
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
Why not?
You live around here?
They grow outside, don't they?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark.
Ms. Kramer.
Your daddy will always love you.
I don't mind.
Why not?
That's right.
How's that?
I'm afraid not.
I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person.
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
How old are you and your sister?
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
What else?
It was a small house.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
So... what's your dark secret?
The morning?
Depraved? My mistake.
No. Never again.
No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
I know.
I've got problems.
We were due to go back out on the same ship. Six months of tests.  If you were married you got a state-room.  Otherwise it was bunks.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
How deep's the drop-off here?
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
I can extend that.  There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Chill out, Lindsey!!
Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere...
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
I can't... make it... podner.
Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.
Missed what?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
Without any doubt, sir. If anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island...
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
No.
And how do you explain that?
But why don't you tell him?  A girl who was with us has disappeared.
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
That's why I asked you...
Nothing.
Tell me once more.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
It couldn't be any clearer.
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
What has everybody got against me this morning?
And where do you find the models?
Look, Marshal, with those deep crevasses, you'll need some rope and ladders...
Thank you.
But where did you come from?
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
I would like to ask you something.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
I don't know... I don't know...
Was it Sister Marguerite?
Who?
Oh, yes!
Do you think he loves you?
Yes.
And then what?
What baby?
Is that where they say it came from... ?
From God.
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Anything?
I've stopped menstruating
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Agnes...
No, but I can never tell her that.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
What did you do?
Yes.
She...
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Are you intelligent?
Doctor Livingston.
Yes.
Yes.
Of what?
No... don't hit me please...
Do you remember what just happened?
What did she mean?
So I could go to him.
How did she know about him?
Where?
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Agnes who did you see?
I hate him...
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Who are you?
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
Do you still go to church?
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
Two packs a day.
And you didn't try to find out who?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Why do you think that?
And in your eyes?
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
Not simple, no.
The Catholic Church...
Answers.
Oh, some time in January.
Earthquakes?
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
No, it reminds me.
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
For the Church?
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
Somebody told her.
Did you know she was pregnant?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
Too late for what?
I left it with her and I went for help.
Then she's a liar.
Eh?
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
Y'what?
The police station.
Oh now, they can't do that to me.  It's all your fault.  Oh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...
I've made the scene.
Bag-snatcher.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
Grotty?
A butcher?
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Well, let's broaden our outlook.
Wake up!
Is he?
Follow your impulse.
The old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
I see.  Do you like the play?
Thank you.
Why selfish?
See you.
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
What?
You see, sly villains.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Shall I?
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
He started it.
Ah, go on, you swine.
Well you're not going.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
I'm not, no.
Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
But...
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Nerves.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Well, he can't stop here.
Kill drive engines.
Is it solid?
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
A voice transmission.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
It grows on you.
It's still in the ship?
Right.
And be right back.
Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
Boy, that's terrific.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Good!  That's good!
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
No.
We're not going anywhere.
Oh... God...
Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
Yes, thank heaven.
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
We're going into the freezers now.
The commander normally has first publication rights.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Let's hear it.
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Tell you what, Martin.  As soon as the engine's fixed --
Good.
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
With great pleasure.
We've got it up here!  It's trapped! Get up here fast!
Where are you?
I guess we open the door and net it.
Sure.
Thanks.
Shit.  When?
Match it!
Take a look at this.
I'm picking up another signal.
How?
Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
Well... try the headset.
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
And before that?
You should hit the sack, too.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
You're more than modest.
A revolutionary approach to the Theater. However, if I may a suggestion...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
Yes. The Shubert.
Just some coffee.
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Lloyd and I.
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
You have no right to say such things!
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
I don't know what I take you for anything...
What do you mean by that?
Yes, Addison.
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
Like a nylon lemon peel-
Huh?
Call me when you get in...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
And who remembered it? Who was there on the dot, at twelve midnight...?
What?
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
You were great.
Yes, dear.
A cowboy.
Why.
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
What have I got to do with it?
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
Buy some.
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
Hmm?
She's loyal and efficient-
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
How did you get in here?
Hollywood.
You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
Performance number one thousand of this one - if I play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
I've got it.
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
Hello, Miss Channing.
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
It doesn't matter.
Why should he - and why should you?
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
I can't believe Eve said those things!
You'll be there, won't you.
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
They'd die without each other.
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
When you do, let me in on it.
The play? All right, I guess...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
You'd have been proud of her.
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
That's right, but I don't understand-
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
Are you breaking the contract?
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
About the past year.
You want me to be the bastard.
--just that a lot of reports were sent to CREEP, but he doesn't name who, not here anyway--
--shit, who do we know?--
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
I wish we were investigating Attila the Hun.
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Oh.
You can't.
I've got a lot of energy.
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
You're the fella who forgot he rented a Hertz car, do I have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
I could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts.  Put him on.  Ken, I'm sorry, it was Goddamn Beirut and they were having a crisis, what's up, kid?  Slow down, Ken, you sound frazzled.  A wife and a family and a cat and a dog, right, Ken.  Ken, I would never print that you were in Marilyn's apartment at night-- unless, of course, you force me to.
Absolutely--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
It's right under that pile.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
Who by?
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
Look, I told you inside--
Well, they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel. And that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counsel--they never even made a phone call.  So if they didn't ask for you to be here, how did you know to come?
There is no reason to assume other people were involved.
Your clients were arrested with a walkie-talkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves.
Where?  What do you mean, where?
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Ratfucking.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
You get nothing from me about Haldeman?
When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
--well, what if your boys get it wrong--
Don't know; who the hell's Howard Hunt?  It's probably nothing but check it out. Just go easy, it could be crazy Cubans.
Lotsa hints--
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
--can we use their names?--
You handed out the money. Maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done--
There's something about the spring that's just cool.  Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
Neither will I.
You don't like it?
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
I do, baby, I do.
You can crash at Stifler's?
So, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
But --
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Pontificated.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
He's going in!
Holy shit!
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
Okay, I get it.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
After getting laid?
Uh...yeah...sorry.
God dammit, Stifler!
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Kevin, this is serious!
How?
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
Just a second!
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
What's that?
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
Stifler!!
Yeah right.  I got an idea for something new.  How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
Thanks.
Uh huh.
No it isn't! You're dead!
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
Where?
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Andy...
You'll never get the chance.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
Looks like he lied to you too.
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
Claude.
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
He says -
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
What were you showing her?
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
It's not you - it's the dress!
Sad?
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
Ah! Let us begin!
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
What do you mean, next?
Why not?
Do you feel all right?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Lyndon Johnson?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
The alarm clock.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Get him!
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Well, then, w-who was?
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
Oh, you do?
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Oh, all right.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Ooooh!
That's the key question.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
It relaxes me.
Oh, come, you don't need that.
M'hm.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Oh.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Yeah.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
Nothing at all?
Remember that day?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Don't get upset!
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
I can think of another word.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
It's a narrow view.
Tell him.
Mean?
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Oh, Jesus.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
And... uh-
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
She was stealing.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
I was a great beauty.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Why didn't you come in?
Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and...  The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice?
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
I have a small window of time.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
Borrow whatever you like.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Never.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
I love her too, Joe.
Can I open it?
She's in ICU.
Monica.
Excuse me?
Nice to meet you.
Forget it, Judy.
Anytime, sport.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
Scout's honor.
Just do what I say, alright?
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
What?
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
You can never be too early or too thin.
Truce.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
It's not like this all the time.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
It's a Calder.
Yes, she is.
Not long.
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
Oh.  You're serious.
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
Lemon.
And he doesn't smoke?
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
God willing.
Excuse me?
Let's just go home, okay?
No, no thanks.
Oh?
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Yeah.
Are you lovesick?
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
We're just feeling our way back.
You know it's true.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
I don't want to talk about it.
I never like to talk about my work.
Would you like to meet my husband?
The both of you.
So how much do you hate her?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
Yes.
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
Let's dig in!
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
And do Princesses do improper things?
You did?
I...I have no idea, sir.
ONE TO NOTHING!
So...you two are in love?
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
Sheldrake?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Oh!
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
How is your cold?
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway.  I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
Why?
I think so.
I don't understand --
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
Let me help you.
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Who?
Miss. 
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
A cemetery?
Gin.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Yes, nurse.
The dishes?
Of course not.
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Gas?
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
That's very flattering.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
I am?
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Oh?
Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
Mr. Sheldrake?
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Wednesday -- Wednesday --  I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Family?
No.
No kidding.
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
Yes, I know.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
You're not being funny.
Now, Fran --
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping --  -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
Baxter?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
It's a thought.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Propagate -- you know, multiply -- baby flies?
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
Delta ?
Yeah. Way north.
None.
Fat. That's real fat.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
No shit.
How much is left?
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Where ?
All right I got a little surprise for you --
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
This is years ago, before he joined Special Forces, I guess. We had an argument.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
You'll find enough Cong up there.
The kid can't ride sloppy waves.
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
We'll exterminate the fuckers !
Yes I was... He said his last words to me.
Just something I read in the Free Press.
Yeah... thanks.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
You think he'd of shot us?
Any time -- us -- Americans.
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
That's me.
It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.
Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz.  You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy.
So Kurtz is alive.
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
Cognac?
Kurtz.  I know you've heard of him.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
Right now -- I am.
I do.
Beverly Hills --
What?
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
Your infrared camera?
Six months.
Oh.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Bastards took off, though, didn't they?
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
Come here...
My home is here.  With you.
That makes the flight more interesting.
You want to fool yourself about that bullshit job, fine.  Damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along.  You think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man -more-
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
I'm real sad you don't approve of me.
You're wrong.  Everything we do leaves its mark.  You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
What's the problem with Sam Wilder's place?
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
We'll go with you.
Aw, Jesus.  Told you this was trouble.  What about you, big shot?  Do something.  Who's side are you on, anyway?
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
No.
I've got Jews at my table.
I see the help -- judgement call.
What do you care?
His name?
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
How do you know about my mother?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
No, sir...
My son.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Takes months to know... They work little by little.  Talking like this is exhausting.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
That seems like a good choice.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
Go ahead.
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
Uh-huh...
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
You changed the room around...
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
So am I, Frank.
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
Oh, is he dead?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Oh, my gosh.
Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
Does it matter?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
Right.
What is this?
Sounds like chickenshit --
We both know what you were doing.
We go around once.
Know what?
The bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
Now you understand why I'm here.
Right.
I'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why I shouldn't shoot you.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
More or less.
Why not?
But you knew what they were training you for?
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
Ahhhh...
Women?  No... not really.
Why did you leave the Agency?
That's fiction.
Really?
Taiwan.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except --
I was.
Yes.  Here I am again.
How do you know they're not?
Jesus, if someone had --
I heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  I wanted to, so I did.
I know.  It makes me crazy.
Are you attracted to me?
What happened to her?
Oh, God.  I see it!
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
All the time.
Can you tell me about it?
I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
And an R.C.
What do other guys do?
Why didn't you fade?
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
A coke, if they have it?
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
Good, I love swinging a shovel.
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
I don't know Doug, we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it.
Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
No beer?
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
What?
They ain't the only ones.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
You could give me your baseball, so I can drive this bastard nuts.....He's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
That one?
Turn around quick!
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
I've been around.
You used to read.
Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.
You're everything a guy could want.
No way Doug, I can't.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Sure, I've done it easily.
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
What for?
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
Sure!
Why don't we both forget about him?
No!
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
I insist, it is the least we can do.
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
It's more than what you're worth.
Josh, I have to speak you, it's urgent.
That was not my decision, I can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored. In the meantime no one else must know those files exist. Secure the building and I will arrange alternative safe storage immediately.
It was all on a Russian format, I don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance.
Subtitles) You have made many mistakes Pavel, let there be no more, for your sake.
That's over. Way over.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Later.
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
This play -- ?
Maybe a little of both.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
And that would ruin your reputation how?
It's not.
Why not?
I know you want to.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
What do you actually know with religion?
What about your father?
I'm not going back to school.
That was read at my parents' wedding.
I thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship.
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
I have expectations, too.
I don't want to see her hurt.
Ever again.
Like what, sir?
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
Getting by.
For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
I didn't say you did.
You came here to give me my report card?
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Marty. What's for breakfast?
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Learn anything?
What drill?
Good.
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Well... yeah...
Why what?
Oh. Uh... 'Hey, you! Get your damn hands off her!'  George paused. You really think I should swear?
Yes, definitely, god dammit George, swear. Then you hit me in the stomach, I go down for the count, and you and Eileen life happily ever after. Now, hit me in the stomach.
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
Five cents, please.
...To be traveled through
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
You know me?
Marty.
That's just great!
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Jesus!
Good. Professor Brown tested the tarp, noting in satisfaction that it was secure. I'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight. Don't be late -- we're cutting it close as it is. We've got a long drive ahead of us.
A car.
A Tab.
What do you mean?
Sure thing. Come on.
No, you're not either.
What?
Sure.
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
No.
Just thinking.
Fine.
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
Just gimme a chance.
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
So I was right.  That's nice to know...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
It?  Who does?
What is it, Tommy?
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
Now!
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Everybody okay up here?
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
You look!  It's not here!
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
I didn't drop 'em.
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Please, Barton.
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
What are they like? What are they about?
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?
What else?
And what would that be, son?
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Then who should I talk to?
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
A souse!
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
What do you do far a living?
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, because I respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. One, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night  if the show sells out.  Eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
No, what did it say?
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
Hell, I could tell you some stories
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and  and  and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. In my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back  with interest. How about family, Bart? How're you fixed in that department?
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine  you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
What a dump...
So they say.
You gotta believe me 
What do you think happened?
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
I'm at the Earle.
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
You don't have to cover for him. It's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
Excuse me?
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
Well, some of his throat was there.
No reputable company would hire a guy like that.
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
Excellent picture.
We got a treatment on it yet?
Did you find out about her parents?
No.
No?
Catherine Tramell.
Who?
Sometimes I really hate you.
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
I don't smoke.
Why not?
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
No.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Ice?
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
No.
No thanks.
What happens to them?
Somebody has to die.
He was murdered.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
I like that.  "Suspension of Disbelief."
Sometimes.
You did.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
I said keep it.
She killed him.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Let's get out of here.
You haven't been by lately.
I know that. Don't let him get away.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
Yes, I understand  but where do you take them from?
What are they?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
 In this corner?
Thanks.  Your dad called again  something about a job.
About what?
Oh  you mean black people!
Oh man! Folklore guy  worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
It's Monday morning.
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
You mean babies with you?
What's wrong with me?
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
So what?
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
I need this?
No, nothing, ah ...  His parents ... I ... I hope he finds them.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
I'm -- sorry, I --
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Y'mean take off our costumes?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
It does to me.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
I don't.  So, no.
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
Specify, please.
Why?
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Definitely.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
What?
Bruce?  What are you doing?
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Dick, don't push me right now.
Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
You lie!
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Bruce. Son. Listen to me. You are a kind man. A strong man. But in truth you are not the most sane man.
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Enigma.
Why's that?
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
What do you know about obsession?
To kill me.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
What? This isn't normal?
What?
They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
Excuse me.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Yesssssss. I know!
I got family. ...Please.
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Let's see if you bleed green.
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Everything.
Miss.
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
You sunk my battleship.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
Alfred, bring something for Mr. Knox -- I'll have one, too.
Too much work.  I'm not really the physical type -- Thank you, Alfred.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Why, Eckhardt.  You should be thinking about the future.
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Thanks, Annie.
David?
No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Well, there is that ...
You.
Yeah, heh heh.
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Uh... Uh...
Cool, huh huh.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like, everything looks all weird and...
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Butt-snatch...
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Really? I poop too much.
Where did these guys come from?
Bork, when this is all over, remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Who knows?
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
Yup. Huh huh.
You'll be rich!
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
What?
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
What's she doing here?
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
Not really...  what's this?
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
What about this Beetle guy?
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Give or take a year.
We're ghosts.
Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C on science.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
Can you scare them off?
We're...
What do you mean?  What's he do?
Yeah.  He still tries popping up all over the place.  But he can't join the party unless you call on him.  Get the Deetzes out by yourselves! I gotta go.
About what?
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
Your fingers are so small I can't see them.  First word -- two syllables.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Good girrrl!
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
Just don't tell Lydia.
I think she's in with them.
Lydia.  What the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  Go help your mother.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
Any particular kind?
It wasn't a joke.
Tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids. Kids!  I love them.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
It doesn't matter.  What matters is I've got a roomful of guests down there, who think I'm a fraud.  I am going to teach you something here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  Come on out, or I will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Maybe Charles does.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes.
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
No.
Hardly any, Robert.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
Certainly, glad to be of help.
A Black man gave me the message.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
My name is Chance.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
Good night, Eve.
Yes.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Our greenhouse.
Hello, Eve.
Thank you, Eve.
Yes. That could be true.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Thank you.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes. I like that name very much.
Thank you.
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Oh, you can tell her later. She'll never miss you in this crowd.
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
Yes.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
Of course. I would like to look.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
... Yes, Louise, it's snowing in the garden today. Have you looked outside and seen the snow? It's very white.
Yes, I'm very hungry.
You're welcome.
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.
Thank you.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
... Joe? Who's Joe?
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Yes, I understand.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
... Hello.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
Yeah... I'll have a talk with him as soon as...
... Yeah...
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
So...? Where the hell is it?
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
Who am I thinking of?
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
I have to go back now.
Fuck Maxine.
And he was with her.
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
You fell in love with her first.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
He's a lucky man.  Do I know him?
I am a trained performer.
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
My tits?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Look, I'm going back to my house to ponder this. So stay calm and keep track of Schwartz's comings and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose of Schwartz's wife, will you?  Nice to meet you all.
Why are you being like this?
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
You bastard!
Yes, Hi.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Oh, Lotte...
I'd love to see your work.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Sleepy suddenly.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Was a time I knew what was.
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
Thank you.
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
What you want'em for?
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Could be that fall you took.
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
But mama..
Till she showed herself.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Just me.
Never found out.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
What? What? You talking back to me?
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
No sir, I don't, but I know Plank Road. 'Bout a mile up thataway.
Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
We have the urn.
That is for the urn.
I'm going home, Donny.
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
Huh?
Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit.  They're not gonna do shit.  What can they do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.  Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong?
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
Yes, uh, very impressive.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Nancy's pretty good.
I see.
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
In the briefcase?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.  You will receive no bill.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
She most certainly was not!
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Do you still have that doctor's number?
I want you to see him immediately.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl. Drive around.  The occasional acid flashback.
He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it.
Am I wrong!
Yeah, but--
Hey man--
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Calmer than you are.
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?
I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around!
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No one is going to cut your dick off.
This whole fucking thing--I  could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.
Huh?
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson!
Huh?
Yeah.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
Okay, listen--
I said out.  Now.
Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an eight.
This is a league game, Smokey!
We'll take 'em in the morning.
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
What?
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Not good.
Took you long enough.
I don't like it.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Then who does he work for?
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
You're wasting your time, Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Two things.  One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
Ain't nobody here but you and me, chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
You should've killed her, then.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
No, we can treat the wounds --
Frost!!!
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
Show me.
Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
Like what?
Nothing that won't heal by dawn.
Blade --
Cancer.
I know. Take some of my blood.
You don't have to be.
What?
You're wrong, Dragonetti.
We weren't sure we could trust you.
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
Habit, mostly, just like this.
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
I'll take my chances.
Try, please, Anna--
Think again.
The Witch's voice.
Oh, sorry, right.
What?
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Here.
Yeah.
Both. Now.
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.
--and unlike the first one, every second of it's gonna be true! "Blair Witch: The Real Story!"
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Yeah?
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
Too busy eating us?
My room, asleep, last I checked.
No idea--goddamitt!
--I saw what I saw.
Yeah. Me too.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
<u>What</u>--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
--about the Witch--
Spite.
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Okay.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
Get some more beer.
Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
I'm sorry.
Domini.
--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine <u>are</u>!
I don't....
What happened to my Dad??
Thanks.
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
All right...
In the trunk.
What do you want to know?
About ten years.
Ever durned one.
...Friday?
Lubbock?
You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
How long did you watch her?
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
Well what?
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
...What?
Has Ray come in yet?
Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.
Thanks Meurice.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Yes?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Yeah.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Then you got undressed.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Do you know?
Then don't talk about killing.
Frank? .can you stand up?
I'm alright. go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet.
No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
Please. please stay.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Yes.
Just get outta my bed.
You. what?
No.  Hi baby.
My secret lover.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
I don't want to go.
That's too bad.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Oh bother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor.  Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yeah.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Two.
Are you sure?
Goodnight.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's okay.
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Go ahead.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Hey Jeff.
Well.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
You'll see for yourself.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.
I heard.
That was out of line.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
What's the other one?
Allo?
Do we need a plane?  How does this work? When do I see you?
Just a friend.
Try the back bedroom.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Cocaine?  How much?
Oh, I see.
Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
No.
Did you know I died two weeks after you sent me that tape?
I don't think so.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
California, huh?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
But I've got school.
I swear on your life.
I know, Dad.  I know...
Shhhh.
They're over at the booth.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
I wish there was shit like this back home.
So, we need to get to the source.
Don't be such a pussy.
Second name.
Then don't complain.
Good evening, sir.
Yes, a name for the operation.
Why, yes, of course ... But for the moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! In the mountains our work is always easier.
Because it hasn't all been erased.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
What about the will?
Not sure.  I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
No -- never.
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
Six years.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
She was here?
About a year and half ago.
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
Can you give the court an example?
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
Yes -- several times.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Then what happened?
Yes -- he did.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
Yes.
Yes.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
You know I can't talk about that.
No further questions.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
How?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Great.  I'll see you at the office at nine.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Yeah.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
This is not relaxing.
Really?
He could let you have your vacation.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
Please -- not now.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Not even if they're a dork?
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
What time did you leave?
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
I said NO!
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Well, I'd like to read them.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Nobody did.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -  "Floyd, I'm going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that's all there is to it. He said who's going to make lunch? I said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?  He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I don't even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the Sandford ranch. I am so sorry, honey, I let two days pass before I came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. Have you heard from Richard? How's the fair? God, it's hot.
WHAT!
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
No, your kids.
I doubt that.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
Yes. Very clean.
Oh you!
Do you miss it?
When?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
What?
Francesca?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
Do you want to leave your husband?
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Oh, sure. Great.
Oh, how is he?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
No. I couldn't.
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
What about us? What about me?
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
I'm going to miss you.
What's her name?
I don't remember!
They're not going to find her!
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Hell no!
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Climb out to where?
That's some terrible shit.
Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Just try it.
I said, no thanks.
Let me see your hand.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
And the hell everybody else, right?
You know I can't.
You mean as opposed to your life?
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
I lied.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Here!
Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.  Leave your car and walk over here.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
You were just a kid.
Dad?
Don't call me that.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
Look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
What are you talking about?
The hell I can't!
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
Where, then?
Shut up, Violet.
Good boy.
Sure.
Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You know how I feel about that fucking psycho.
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Hey, Mickey.
What?  They ain't there?
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
You're doing everything yourself?
Truck.  Of course.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
Almost five years.
Yes, it is.
I don't.
What you heard wasn't sex.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
I think so, too.
Yes.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Any bodyguards?
He won't.
Why?
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
Violet?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
We don't know what we're into!
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
What do they want me to do?
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
Keep it. 
MPG Capital.
I don't know.
You have your passport?
Yes.  Is he there?
You are a friend of his?
That'd be great.
Oh, Jesus... 
I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
I won't hurt you.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Where are we?
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- let me do this, okay? --
I don't know. 
You have ID?
He run away often?
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
Get everyone down in the basement.
Wait a minute --
All of them?
Uh - what? - I ...
...elephoned sir.
Got there!
... ere please.
Too late? That's for me to say.
Me? - if I'm worried about anyone, it's you. What happened to you, Sam? You were the brightest of us -
You are late.
Triplets.
Really? - God, how time flies!
Not really, no.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
I'm sure you have
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Out of kindness.
Take her off the list.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
This is all a mistake. Jack, please take that mask off.
Have you got an Arrest Receipt?
If you say so.
Good!
No.
It's my fucking life.
Ah ... Er ... It looks as if you're taking me.
Looking for you.
No, really.
Well, no system is.
Turn!
"And your children all gone."
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
I've never seen a Ministry cheque before.
Can I forget it?
I did it for you.
Sam Lowry.
Yes.
You haven't switched it on.
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
No need, sir
Numero, trois.
Have you got one or haven't you?
It's all right, Terry, it's all right, everything's all right.
Who fixed your ducts?
What?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
No. Wait here.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before I give you a big hug.  I love this guy.
No underwear?
Dead.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
Yeah?
Oh man, Bucky.
Did you see my father?
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know.
Sure.
Fifteen minutes.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
He'll be all right.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
Frank.
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date?  She hit you with a bottle?
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out.  Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad.
You can't leave me now.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Crazy fucker.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
It's early for him.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
That's ridiculous.
Frank!
You're burned out.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
Yeah, you're right.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Yeah.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
They booted me out of Washington.
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Why?
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
I don't like the word gay.
Did you shoot their boots?
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Yes.
Good.
As good as humanly possible.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Then what was good about it?
People phoned in.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Sit down, stop.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
Thanks.
The cost-efficient reporter.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
It's started.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Bobbie, please.
One's enough.
I like "godsend."
I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Yes, sure.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Me!
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
You fucking...
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.
It's okay.
A picnic?
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Oh yeah?
I wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
I didn't finish talking to you!
Are you nervous, Walter?
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
You're breaking my concentration!
What!
What's it called?
Murdered man.
Thank you.
Oh, I don't know.  Smart people. Creative people I guess.
You think I'm creative?
Is it?  I've forgotten.
I'm totally serious!
Don't ask.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
I do the research.
I know, man.
I-I already got a new one!
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Huh?!!!
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Turn around!
Walter shut up and relax!
Well I'm overjoyed.
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Hiya Maxwell.
With Dead Cat?
I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
Litter, yeah!
Thanks.  Have you seen Jeffrey?
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
I got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I'll have sex with you.
Hi, guys.
So I noticed.
What?
Hi there.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Not exactly.
They were vampires, weren't they?
God!  Unbelievable.  Vampires.
Mmkay.
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
Second word... sound like 'dance'.
He did what he was supposed to.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
'Just remember you're in training, son'
Get a boob job.
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
Wait!
You don't understand.  You have been chosen.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
None of your business.  God.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
No -- you don't have to --
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
If I say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
They were vampires?
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Don't start with me again.
As for example, what?
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Why because it's not my fate?  It's not in the Book-of-All- Knowledgefullness that I'm gonna be cheerleading at the Barber game?
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Football is my life.
And where are they now?
Thank you very much.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Hi.
So very much.
I don't understand.
Got that.
Okay, let's go.
Wit-tay.
Hey, wait a minute...
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Nice much.
You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
Run.
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
You said "Crash".
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
You can't seduce me.
What'd he say?
He's a virgin.
That's my job too.
I heard already.
He looks great, just great!
That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
Who's he play for?
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
If you believe in Voodoo.
You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
How?
Yep.
Naw...
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Yep.  So how's Annie?
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
No.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
Fear and ignorance.
The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
She's playing with my mind.
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
We'll be praying for you.
We'll pray anyway.
Ain't he warning up?
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
...and one helluva guy.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
I'm getting too old for this game.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
Well, I'd rather not say.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
...he did what he was told.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
What are you talking about?
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
You were in the m- You were in the building.
A powerful man.
Oh, good.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
She's not here, Sam.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
Mm-hm.  1862. Okay, good. I'll call you right b-
Right away.
Mommy.
I don't know.
If he don't know, nobody knows. Told you it was eight.
What do you think about me movin' out here?  What's the matter? You got a problem with that?
No, of course not.
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
I'll be honest with you.
What the fuck happened to you? Will you tell me?
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
...to me.
And at the...
...hundred yards further down the road.
Don't ask questions. Just be there.
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
And what'd she want?
Well...
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
No, that's quite all right.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
...position...
Certainly.  Senator.
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
Here we go. Good luck.
I'll be right back.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
What, are you trying to handicap me?
It's chinchilla.
Okay.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
I don't need one.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
All right...
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
Get out of here!
What if he won't stop?
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!  Fuck you!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
I am calm!
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children.
Eight children! 
Well...
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Can't do it with both hands?
So, you're a righty?
What?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
Hey.
Please.
And here. Here.
It looked like a fuckin' gun!
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Here we go!
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born.
Great!
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I understand.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
I do.
He gives a fuck what I do?
Okay.
Nothin'.
No, he wouldn't. I would have.  And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously.  Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Yeah.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-
Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
Yeah.
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
All right.
Get up.
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
This is Nick.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot.
Charlie M.
Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
I'm sorry.
In women?
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
You're serious?  You'd help me...
She has a real spirit.
I suppose she does.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
What's the name of your child's best friend?
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Okay, deal.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
Or relieve me of it later.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
If you know that just back off.
Make a "U" and go back.
What do you keep making me out to be?
What am I supposed to do?
My name is --
I don't want to know --
Then hang up!  Do it!
No -- nothing.
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
26th off Wilshire.
What are you doing now?
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
Hey drop it, okay?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Well you did.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
That makes two of us.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
Black Mercedes, 600S.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Did you hear that click?
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
Include me in that.
They put their hands all over me.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
He wants 75 back.
I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
I don't want it.
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
They saw you kill the driver.
There are no guarantees in this life.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
Got a phone in that van?
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
I still don't see you.
Negative.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
I'm backing up.
Who's this?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Five minutes.
Believe me.  They couldn't be busier at the moment.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Mind if I have a look?
Who are you?
Let me talk to the lady again.
Very official.  259-7881, if I recall.
Is that good or bad?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
Now, that was a look.
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Persistent.
You heard me --
Jimmy.
It's him, isn't it?
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Whatever it is she does for you.
It's a simple question.
Not in my experience.
The accent, I suppose.
And what's it like?
Who's she?
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
But I'm not cheap, you know that? Loud, but never cheap.
Where?
The one you gave me in the Metro.
I'm not on my own, am I?
Doesn't know the meaning of the word.
How different?
That's good...
Maybe.
Want to look after you.
Shut up.
I know that.
Make it up to me, then.
All right, they do.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Don't be cruel.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
Yes.
No. Sit down.
Stop it, Dil --
Just don't kick Dil and she'll be touched. Be nice to her and she'll be yours forever.
Try and go, then.
It's my name, Dil --
Tell me what she wore.
I promise.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
That's wise, Tommy.
All right, then. I like to be wise.
Do you want some food?
My pleasure.
He's hot.
Suits you.
He ran. I couldn't shoot him in the back. I tried to catch him. He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Would make me feel better about it.
You sure about that?
And who is she?
A hotel?
Good. So what do you think?
What do you mean you can't?
Not in your nature.
No?
What the fuck were you doing here?
I got sent.
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Toffs' game there. But not at home.     .
My pleasure, Jody
Don't be so sure.
Having a pint in the Rock.
Like what?
What do you believe in?
When I was a child...
No.
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
Whatever you say, Jude...
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
That's right.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Yes, you told me.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
Then who did? You're the only one left.
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Were you followed?
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
That's not Carson Dyle.
Barely, yes.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
But no one actually saw him die.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
There must be some way.
Which one are you?
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Why can't you be serious?
There, you said it.
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Why?
What -- like Scobie?
I don't think I know that one.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
Yes.
I am a tradesman, Madame, not a doorman. And don't forget these.
Did you?
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
No -- but I will ask.
I don't know -- how would I know?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Yes.
Instant divorce you mean?
We'll find you a hotel.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
Be careful, Peter.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Wha -- what do you want?
You think on it real careful-like, Miz Lampert -- y'hear?
Don't you want me to stay?
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
What?
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
Who invited you?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
Your mind is just twisted enough. I believe you'd do all this just to get a dip or two.
So?
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
No.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
Don't you want to talk to him? You watch him eat everyday.
You're going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
FINE. Are you?
What party?
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Not at all. In fact, I thought about going.
I'm not using him as an excuse.
Hi princess.
Not that I know of.
The word is Mob.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
Are you Jody?
Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.

Arlo, shut up.
 Okay.

Oh, shit.

Whoo!
What do you think I'm doin'?!

I think so too.
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
Ooh.
Yeah.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
We're worried...
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
...Arlo, and you screwed me for it. Now, where's my goddamn truck?
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Alert seventy-fifth rangers.  Code Blue. Tell them Elvis has left the building.
And I changed the schedule.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...I wish they would've let me say something...
Is this stool taken?
You look fit...healthy...
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...that.
Grateful?
...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
Brynner.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Tell the choppers we're lifting off!
Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis.  They had a tactical withdrawal.  It's just those two amateurs now.  Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?

Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Negative.  Negative.

And where are you going?

 No, that's not possible, Mason.  The trout...

If that's what it says.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Maybe.
What about her?
I've got her.
Where is she?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
No thanks.
In the garage.
Curly, you know how long I been in business.
No?
When I do, you'll hear about it.
Didn't you call?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
I want the rest of the pictures.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
Too late for what?
Shut up.  Go on.
Matter of fact I do.
Yeah.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Certainly not!
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Please call first.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
I can't tell you.
What for? There's nothing more to say.  Get my car, please.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Oh.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
And Hollis knew about it?
What? What is it?
They can't be.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
Working for the District Attorney.
Doing what?
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
Could you do anything about it?
Including the death of your husband?
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
Yes.
Where's the girl?
I think I got something.
Ida Sessions.
Don't know her. Take a number.
Of course.
Oh, good.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Yes?
When it comes.
Yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, I don't care how soused he was. That's like drowning in a teaspoon.
Who?
Then go home and forget about it.
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
They were partners.
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt! 
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
We'll talk about that later.
For what?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
I didn't see that.
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
Certainly not.
September the ninth?
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
Hello, Bernstein.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
Charles.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
No, it can't.  Good night, darling.
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
Yes.  The bulldog's just gone to press.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
- And left?  Of course they'll hear.  I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
On the other hand -  I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests!  I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher.  I think I'm the man to do it.  You see, I have money and property -
A wasted day.
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
Yes?
They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Go ahead.
You might have made the whole thing less personal!
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
If I want to, I can go to court. A father has a right to -
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Yes, sir.
Good!
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
Don't you think I do?  You say you're going down to Xanadu?
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
It's not the same.
No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
You're kidding.
You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
And you said yes?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Was I right?
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
But can we date?
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
What about Sing?
I'm just kidding.
Who doesn't?
I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.
Um... okay.
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
With this guy locked in?
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
In a second!
I can whip your ass.
Yes.
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Annoying Customer.
Peptic ulcer.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
He assured me that he'd be here by twelve.
What smells like shoe polish?
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
You called Caitlin again?
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
You know what I just watched?
There's more?
Yeah.
Basically.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
Each egg has to be perfect.
Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.
What kind of show?
Which ones?
Why not?
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
See? There you go again.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
If you go, I go.
An embolism in a pool.
An embarrassing way to die.
He broke his neck trying to suck his own dick.
Balls resting on his lips.
I never tried it.
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
You want to rent a movie.
You work in a video store!
You're bullshitting.
Little girl. Maybe five years old?
Then how come you got the fine?
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
This is my way of spitting water at life.
You're a snake.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
What time did we go to the funeral?
I think four.
Why do I have this life?
What are you talking about?
Leave her out of this.
What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.
To talk to you.
You need a ride?
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Yes.
No, she's getting married.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
I'm not dealing.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
Jesus... go ahead.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
Bunch of savages in this town.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
You're trusting.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Really?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
"Be there?"
And I actually date you?
These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
Including you; yes.
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
I'm not the pig you are.
Oh my God! Why did you tell me you only slept with three guys?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Goodbye, Dante.
Really?  You're the best.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
Veronica... I... it's not like that anymore... I mean, it was never really like that...
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
What?
I didn't do that!
He knows some English, but he can't not speak it good like we do.
You hope what feels good?
Screw you!
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
I... I don't know what to say.
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
Which one?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hal will have my head for this.
I copy.
So, what do you see?
What usually eats a banana?
Y'know, Jessie, doesn't Frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you Frank?
I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
That's a virtue isn't it?
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
Enough.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
I know...
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Which could maybe what?
Listen to you...  The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
What are you doing here!?
Yeah, let's go.
Yeah?
Sure, just give it back when you're done.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Next time, date only basketball players.
This rope is sixty years old!
These old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  I'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
I don't know.  I don't know.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
I burned it.
Never could save a thing.
What the hell's going on?
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
Sue me.
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
We've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
I've been cured.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Good evening.
Won't you join me, sir?
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
Just a manner of speech, sir.
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful rookerful of money each.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
No, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Through there for a bath.
We're going to friends now, sir.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Oh.
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing that pops into your mind.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
What?
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
First Friday of the month?  Linens. Roll right off the trucks.  They're in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  Traffic will be smooth.
You got a deal.
It's no big deal.
Bottega.
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
Save me the grief.  Step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
I'm sorry.
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
He could'a been depressed.  It still doesn't tell me homicide.
Elvis?
Detective Sergeant Phil Heller.
Not our call, Phil.
No harm done, ma'am.
Oh, call me Ida.  To what do we owe the pleasure?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
Mom, Vincent.  Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke.
...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here.  That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
Me, specifically?
What else calms you down?  Candy? Cigarettes?  Sex?  Breathe.
I can't believe this.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
Jazz.  Music.
I'm not catching a melody.
No.
Don't start.
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
I'm sorry.
In case <u>who</u> checks?
The man who hired me for this contract.
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Paid sick leave?
Who's Heller?
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
I, uh, I have some problems.
Just drop me off.
Sure was.  Pounded the V.C. for this Greek cat named Ari Onasis.
Shut the hell up.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
You bit someone's nose off?
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
Switch the charts.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
You're certifiable.
This would be it?
Never heard of him.
Never, but I've been practicing.
You watch me, don't you?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Not today.
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
Because he believed me.
It's okay.  You...  You thought I was bad.
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
Please, sit.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
It was.  It was.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
Night after that?
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
Wasn't my idea.
There's no plug to pull.
Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
No, thanks.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
With me.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
Put it on speakers.
It can't be coming from Vega, the system's too young.
And a hundred mile airspace.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
A machine.  But a machine that does what?
Peter Valerian.
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
Greenbank?
It's really happening.
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
I got two years.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
Git to work!
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
Yes, Boss.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
So then you just call him.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
A Lucas Jackson.
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
Stop beatin', man. You ain't doin' nobody no good.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
Fifty's a nice round number.
We got it locked in the sock.
You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money!
That fool. That damn fool.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Gettin' up, Carr.
Damn.
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
What are you talking about?
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
None of your fucking business.
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
Hal has it.
The same as the first time...
When was that?
The door was already open...
She don't want it.
What book?
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
In jail.
Where are you, Peter?
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
I think this is number three...
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
How did you know they were stockings?
Work with me.
But it's a different m.o.
Please thank Inspector Goetz for taking care of me last night.
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
It's what Bianchi and Buono injected into one of their victims.
I'm giving you Clint outside.
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
Let me get a little action started here.
She on the passenger side?
Is there a phone booth there?
You take it, hang on to it, it'll make you feel safer.  Stay put.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
You know, M.J., when I watch you shoot, I realize I've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?
Honest to God, Ruben!
I like women like that!
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
Look at her legs.
Spread out like she was sexually assaulted here.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
If this is a first step in kicking me off the case, just tell me, to my face, sir, don't waste time being diplomatic.
How'd you get in on the deal?
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
And her husband? What was he?
You're not envious?
Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
James.
Can I give you a lift?  I somehow find myself driving again.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
You're kidding.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
I did this already.
It's hospital policy...
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
There's nothing to tell.
Please, Letty.
And the party?
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
But what am I going to do?
Mom, please.
As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
Yeah?
To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
By color.
No.
A rose is a rose.
Break up?    They wish.
I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
I don't like lamb.
Do you?
Michael, I...
But I do.     I love you, too.
Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
You're so wrong.
I think I should go home.
Why'd you tell?
Yeah, the plans.
Good going. I knew you could do it.
Sure. Why?
I've met someone else.
I heard about your friend.
Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
I dunno.
Marcel?
No.
You're calling me on is phone?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
He missed three weeks.
Angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
I know they won't be home tonight.
I'm not any closer than you are.
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
Has to be.
You better.
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
A thousand dollars?
We had a deal.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Great fuckin' song.
Go where?   The police are outside.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
They sort of got away.
Uh huh.
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
I know where she went.
Oh, you think?
Wait here.
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
I don't know.
Something like that.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
Well, Li Mu Bai can do it.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
It is trouble for me.
Yes.
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
Save your strength.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
But don't be too lenient.
We must avenge mother!
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
I knew that.
You're welcome.
He has a room, upstairs.  I don't like him very much.
Does she have a name?
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
I don't know you.
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
Do you know what you destroyed?
That's ancient history.
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile.
Not a Plymouth Fury, I bet.
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
You talking to me?
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
And you promise to abide by it?
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
No.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
It's because I don't trust myself with you.  I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
Where are you going?
Get off me.
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
The football stud?
Those are my letters!
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
That's great.
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
No.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Okay.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
That's one way of looking at it.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
I see your point... though why should I care?
Sounds intriguing.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Even there?
What's your plan of attack?
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I hate it too.
Any day now.
Yippy.
And that's why you're losing your bet?
Morning.
Where is she?
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Tell me all the details.
It was... Fantastic.
No, tell me.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
You wanted an answer to your question.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
It's the least I can do.
She's out.
Nope.
Yes,  She's a little odd, I understand.
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
I got my wish anyway.
Irena.
Irena.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
You make me sound like the father in "East Lynne."
You do that, Edward.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy.  They wouldn't play with me.
It's true.
And who did the voice belong to?
Yes, Amy?
In the garden? Would she be there now?
But there's no one here, darling.
No.
I'm your friend.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Of course,
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
I shall wear it in my hair!
She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE>                                AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
Now, I don't know Amy --
She pleaded so to do it
I like to see her happy.
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Your lips look delicious.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Nearly four.
Now it's menopause. She's always hot. I gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It's always something.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
And she got the medium.
Maybe they have to pee.
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
No, did you fuck him?
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
It is so hot in here.
No they're not.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
Shit, I guess I missed work.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
DON'T call the police.
Why not? There's been a murder.
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
So what do I do?
Sure. See ya.
You don't have to pee.
Uh huh. So pee.
No.
Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
I think we should do something with strong female characters...
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
So what book did you buy?
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
No. Nope, nothing in it.
No, I got it. It's okay.
No, but thanks for the warning.
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
What about... those guys... I might have...
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
You got a dog?
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
I told you she was innocent.
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
Dont ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Good.
Wrong?  Look at this!
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Don't know much, do you?
What?
That's right.  Just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  No mistake.  I just hadn't remembered it that way.  Up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  That's not all.  Once I started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  It was like a game. I would think about a person or a place, or an event.  Then I would turn the lights off.  Sit down in a comfortable chair...  And study each detail of this subject.
No...  No doctor...
There.  Behind the cabinet.  Where does it go?
It must be a closet or something.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
Not that again...
No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
How do you know I'm innocent?
The usual...
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  Hands to the side...
... Alright.
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Nightmare...
Don't call the Vice President!
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob.  He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
Check his kids.
Clean.
Nobody's got clean kids.
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
Oh.  Fine.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
I'm not sure.
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
Extend them.  C'mere for a second.
I don't think so.
Oh.
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Fine.
Quick.  Gimme a quarter.
We vetoed that?
Why?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
Certainly.
He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
No.
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
What about it?
What's that?
Oh... right...  You know, ever since the stroke...
Since when do you care about the homeless?
Anybody would have done it.
I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
Tonight?
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
Come on!
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
Sir, Tyler is innocent of any crime against the State. Captain Rhodes is...
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
For the good of mankind. That's what every monster-maker says.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
I'm alright. Let's go.
Actually I don't
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
Meeks, you're the brain here.  What do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?!  What about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
Isn't he precious?
I'm not?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Your family move into that new house, Mr. Overstreet?
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
What happened?
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
Knox!  what are you doing here?
Then come with me.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
A crazy madman.
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
A sweaty-toothed madman
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
But father, it's not fair.
Father, I wasn't disputing you.
Yes sir.
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
Oh. 
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Did you clear this?
Then who are you?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Anti social?
On the side!!
Takes one to know one.
You should talk...
...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games...
For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast.
And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening.
What the hell does that mean?
What is it man?
She fucked me too.
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
Hey! Fuckin' A!
Jesus, it's freezing!
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
Nick...
Yeah.
But I insist.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
Unfortunately I must now go in, but I leave you my card. Naturellement I pay my players cash American. Just so you know.
I show you. Come. You come.  Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right?
Thanks.
Oh, well...
Nick, we don't know where Sal is... Nick, Angela won't tell us.
No?
Kind of. You didn't know?
Nick, she won't say why.
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Biederman!
Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.
Naw, it's... I mean...
You're going hunting?
I... No. You do this for money?
Playing.
No. No, no.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
I want to go home, Merle.
The shot?
Yeah... I guess.
From Nam?
Hunt with Vince?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
Forget Sal?
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Great. That's great.
Oh. You know. How's it with you?
What's that noise?
What?
Yeah.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
Yeah!
Sure.
Wade's here.
Wade did a little reminiscing.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
I don't want any press on this.  I've got an election to win day after to- morrow.
Kill me if you want.  Hard line me with that 'I ain't got nothing to lose' bullshit.  But you've got plenty to lose 'partner'.  You've got a family.  I'm giving you a chance to see them.  I kept in touch.  She never married. All these years.  Maybe she loves you.  I wouldn't know why.
Nobody's looking.

Trust me.  You don't want to know.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
Not too good.
They always are.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
No -- that's for me to do.
We will --
No, thank you -- what's your name?
Thank you, Belle --
He lied to me again.
You're lying.
You know that you're in my house.
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
It does hurt! And don't you do it again.
No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off.
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Never!
You know darn well it is.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
You really think so?
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
That's what we said.
Your butter money?
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
You'll never change -- will you?
I'm serious.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
It shows on your face.
I don't know, Jabez.
I dunno.
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Mary -- Jabez --
Coming, Ma.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
You aren't angry with me?
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
I'll be there, too!
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
Argyle.  I'm your limo driver.  Hey, nice bag.
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
What are you going to do?
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
I read about them in Time magazine.  When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply.
This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it.
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Ooohh....
Yeah...
Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
You're really crazy.
I gotta listen to it if they think...
No!  They're standing all around me. Seven thousand fucken cops... all around me.
They won't talk to you.
Yeah... yeah!
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
Yeah... huh, thank you.  I'm going to go back, Sonny, to the hospital. They're really nice people.  They're really trying to help me.
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
You frisk me.
Yeah ...
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
Well, what were you doin' back there?
Okay ...
He's all doped up.
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal.  Why don't I take it over now?
I can take care of that.
Okay, don't worry about it.  Stick it in the bag...
Well, they go to guard school.
I don't fool around with you.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
Sure - we like you.
No you don't.
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Everything's all right?  You okay?
Yeah.
Fuck him - let him out!
Dead or alive?

Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
Wyoming ... That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States ... Look, I'll be back.
I never been up in a plane before.
That's all they're interested in - it's a freak show to them.  I can't control it, Sal - let'em say what they want.  Forget it.  It don't matter.
He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>
Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
My Frances? Frances and Charles have been kidnapped? <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT </b>
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
That bitch called me a bitch.
What?
<i>Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'</i>
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
Cunt.
I can certainly think of one more!
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  And I want to have a little fun.
Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.
Is that the only tape you got?
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
You got my back.
Jade, I still love you.
Turn that JUNGLE MUSIC off.  We ain't in Africa.
You're welcome.
I hope the block is still standing.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch!
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
C Duracell.
Negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.
Can you pay me now?
No, just checking.
Do we now?
OK.  OK.
Where's the ice cream?  The Hagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Shit!  I forgot.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
You a blue-moon fool.
Trust me.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Why you gotta curse?
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
You're still late.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Gotta go.  See ya soon.  Everybody happy now?
Y'know, I've been listening and reading 'bout Farrakhan, ya didn't know that, did you?
It's e-vit-able.
It's Prince.  He's a Prince freak.
Forget it, Mookie.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
Twenty minutes.  How come you niggers are so stupid?
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Yeah. How'd you know?
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Just down the hall.
Coming.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
LLOYD, did you ask your parents?
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
I haven't seen you around here before.
I go to school where I live.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Oh, of course.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
Just a guy I hang out with.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
Peg leg?
Put some ice on it.
HARRY! Here he comes.
I don't think so.
Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
HARRY!
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
Oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? That's it. You're out of the cool crowd. Next time Turk's passing out wedgies, you ain't gettin' one.
D2.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Hey, let's go spy on them.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
I... found that rock.
That's because Captain Rob is not a pirate. We've been through this.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Oh, you're good.
You mean the lunch room?
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Special Needs class.
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
Well he missed a great pot of stew!
And...?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
Yes?... How was your journey?
Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly of the spice... ONE SMALL POINT...
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
My Lord?
The Emperor's blade.
Oh great mother!  He's trying the voice. The Reverend Mother said it could save him.
He knows.
Yes...
He's hiding something.
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
We call that one Muad'dib.
They tried and died....  Jessica!
It is my home.
Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count...
Yes.  There is nothing more comfortable.
No.  I don't work here.
I have no next picture.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
No thank you, Eddie.  I'll be alright.
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
So let's make another "Dracula." Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!
I don't know how to make goulash.
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Stop worrying.  This is going to raise your spirits.
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
Correct.  So instead, I stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  Always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
Sound!
And who may you be?
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
We'll do our best.
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
But there's plenty of other parts.
I told you this was gonna happen.
Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
<u>Dr. Acula</u>!
But Bela Lugosi's in it!
No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
Yeah.  I know what it's like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are gonna think of you... My girlfriend still doesn't know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Thanks.  It's actually the only thing I know how to make.  Hey, can you grab that strainer?
I was a fuckin' HACK!  I let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  I let Bela down...
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
Let's get married.
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
I don't know.
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
Yes!
You know, to make the legs move --
So how long have you known Eddie?
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Oh.  Yeah.  You.
What if I'm vomiting?
I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract --
Al!
So?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
You know it.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
Cool.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
What?
When? Today?
Are the TV people with you?
No.
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
Holy sh--
I'm at the hospital.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Everybody's making audition tapes for that Real TV thing.
No.
What are you talking about?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Our foibles, our foibles!
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
I batted!
No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it.
Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you.
Why?
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Shari...
Everybody hates me!
Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
It's me, Ed.
I know.
Me?!
I put his -- who --  Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back.
I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault.
Who's Shari?
Who's --
The pirate ship.
Do you still have it?
Oh, great! Thanks. I'm just going uptown.
Mm.
For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
But you haven't written your novel.
Thank you.
Everything's fine.  Just, you know, school.
Well, I thought that... well, the way it always works is that SGA president does a count, then the SGA advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
I know.
Here they are.
Sure
As far as I know, they--
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant.  And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Hello, Tracy.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Why are you doing this?
You will.
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
Walt needs to see you.
Okay, Jim. I understand.
What is it. Tammy?
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Dave.
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
What...?
I know.
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.
Are you sorry she's dead?
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Yeah.
But you did it anyway.
Call me Dudley.
Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
What are you talking about?
Ma'am, I'm sure she was.
No!  Please leave!
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
Get the fuck away from me.
What?
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
What does that have to do --
You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance --
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
So be it.
Get on it.
Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in Santa Barbara.
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken.
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
Officer White?
He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
What's wrong, Trash?
Yeah.
Yeah.  Me neither.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Who else have you told?
Be careful, Danny.
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Rachel Banks?
Really?
No shit.
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
I'll pay you.
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
How do you know so much?
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
Looks like Detroit.
Jesus. Do you have proof?
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
What if--
Shit.
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Eight.  Size eight.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
No.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
It's okay.
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
Yeah...look--
I know.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
Brill.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Thank you.
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
I'm sorry about that.
What makes you think it's you?
Seat 74.
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
I don't under--
What are you talking--
Some of 'em.
Sure, go ahead.
No "900" numbers.
No, but they took my blender.
What?
Bobby--
I don't know!
You gotta--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, what's going on?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
The originals?
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.
Now.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almsy nods.
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
Dance with me.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Which we've overflown twice.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
What do you want?
No.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise.  To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
That's a different dress.
Do I recognize him?  I recognize what he is. I like him.  He's Canadian.  He can read Italian.  He can catch rabbits.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
I follow the wires.
No. But he hands them over.
This is what I do.  I do this every day.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
Of course.  When?
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
No.  He's - no.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
He's sleeping.
A bit of one.
Yessir.
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
No.  I think I was a pilot.  I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin.  I was with them for some time.
Why?  Are you German?
You got a better idea?
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
I don't know, but close.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
That is of no interest.
Uh. I'm showing off.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
No. Why would I be?
Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Got it.
We're only going one way.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
No. It's a down payment.
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Our equipment has arrived.
It was a long time ago.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
I've got something for you.
In eye of that painting.
Behind you.
The Mask.
A billion dollars.
Get the hell in.
Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
That's because you grew up rich.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. You could come too.
FUCKING THING!!!
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
The key to success is using the right tools.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
Because I never assume anything.
Call it an expression of trust.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
Yeah. Probably not.
Don't use language with me --
What do you think?  What's this?
Which one?
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Yup.
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Good.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
Lemme see it, will you?
What, you think I'm made of money?
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
You think there's more?
They skipped that step.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
He's gone.  Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?
Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor and behave yourself for once.  Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
Why the fuck should I respect her?
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
Uh-huh.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
You see your office?
Yesterday.
Corey.
And ...?
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Not anymore.
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
Hey, just so long as you see Him.
PG& -- Are you sure?
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
I do.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
Lock the door.
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
You did?
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
Ben ... Ben ...
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
Everyone's invited, of course.
What's wrong with him?
I'm looking for a great warrior.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke?
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
How do I look?
But the tremors have stopped.
The entrance is collapsing!
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
Let er go, Chewie.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
That sounds familiar.
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
What is it?
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
They're...pretending to dress.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
That primitive apes can talk.
And we can watch ...
A display of primitive apparatus --
No -- clothes.  Stevie, they changed into them.
I don't believe it.
Security.  Join the Marines and see the Zoo ...
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
I like you.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
I tried...
I thought he was, but he came back.
We have a little arrangement. Anything happens to me, you're dead.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
Dream on, blue eye.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
Good.
It's history. I gotta go.
The name's Plissken.
Man, I'd love to have your autograph, Snake.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Anaheim. Headquarters for everything. The whole town's gonna be there. Things changin' fast around here, Snake. It's not the same as the old days, man.
You need help.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
The what?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
I will not.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
...of course...
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay.
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
I'm going.
And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
Can it truly be used for magic?
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
Just five or six people.
No kidding.
Storage.
Groceries maybe? A package?
I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
Never mind.
That's good.
A stimulant.
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
Are you sure?
Yeah, it would've helped. Have you gotta cigarette Father?
Yes am.
You wouldn't.
I beg your pardon?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Did you know my mother died recently?
What do you drink?
Oh............
You like it?
Here I'll show you.
Captain Howdy.
Who's Captain Howdy?
Oh I bet he is.
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
Okay.
Make it stop,it really hurts! Mother! Make it...
Hi Father.
So what's wrong with her?
Where'd you get it then?
I came to say goodbye.
Sure.
Bon Jour.
Uoy era ohw.
Why?
In the face of the enemy.
The Lord be with you.
And also with you.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
From the psychiatric end.
It's possible. Possible however
Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
Sick priest, is that it?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
...Be gone!!
If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
I'm afraid.
Give me the keys!
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
Catholics.  What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake.
Jack.
Jack.
Christ, will you look at your hair?
Who's gonna make trouble?  Hey, amigo!
Huh?
Yamaha white.  Nice.
You look awful.
Thanks.
Only on odd days.
I don't gotta go.
What're you talking about?
What?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
All right.  What's your name?
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
I didn't get her number.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
How about these?
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
Yeah.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
What's the matter with you?  So the piano's a little out of tune.  So what?
Doesn't it matter to you?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
What?
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere.  Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
Couple years.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
What?
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Later.
No.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
So what'd you think?
All right.
So she's got a few sniffles.
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
What-?
What's wrong with it?
They're nines.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
They must've bought the same map we did.
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
What're you talking about?  They love it.
Will I see you again?
Baker.
All right.  Hold on.
The name's Baker --
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
How's egghead?
Nothing.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
You're kidding.
Oh.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Yeah.
Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Sounds big.  What's he do?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
Huh? Oh, no.
None?
He's losing his teeth.
He hit a guard.
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
Would it?
Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on.  He's nothing like you.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Don't count on it.
Not anymore.
Not if I kill you first ...
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
You mean like ... condoms?
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
What the fuck do you think happened?  Castor Troy just shot him!  What are you waiting for?  GO!
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
You're supposed to be snitching, making me look legit.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
Gone?
Great.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
Okay, I have a confession to make.  But you aren't going to like it.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
Really. So youre projecting what, a tad over two million?
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. Youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Who did?
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Ah. A classic...
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
All Im saying it there isnt a guy in Union County who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to Kate...
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
The Caddy?  Why dont you take your own damn car!
I mean it.  From what I can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
Everyone needs something.
You just said everyone needs something.
Thats my car!  You stole my car!
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Its lovely...
Thanks.  To you too...
For us, Kate.
Look, you dont understand.  I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
Do what?
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?
Ill fix it.  Ill go out right now and get you something.  Ill make it right.
But Im gettin close, right?
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Youre a little tougher, Peter.
I'd like that, too.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
I like the sound of that.
Youthful high spirits.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Yeah, nine years straight.
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
Is it safe?
They're not costumes.
But all these people...
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
And if he's not...?
Sure.
<u>Ben</u> did this?
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
That's what we're here to find out.
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm.  Maybe tie into the city grid...
Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
Trip? Where to?
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
With no laser --
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
You sound as if you're not looking forward to it.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
I always thought it was nothing but red.
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Look! They follow the direction of her glance, are startled to see:
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
Send the following message...
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
No, we should reach the base of the Brain shortly. And from there, it's not far to the site of the injury.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
On the Repeater.
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
Then don't drift down further.
Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
May I have your ticket, please?
Where's my daughter?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Is this a fucking joke here?
...What're you talking about?
Well, okay, it's -
Yeah, you already said that.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
Yah, but this TruCoat -
Any others?
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Yah.
Yah.
Uh-huh.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
Yah, geez, Scotty. I'll go talk to him.
You bet.
What... What is it all about?
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Know who this is?
Whatcha watchin' there?
Norstars.
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
Yah.
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Yah?
You're livin' in Edina, then?
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Anyone else residing there?
So... they didn't...
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Prowler needs a jump.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
He's at Norstar.
We gotta protect Jean. These - we're not holdin' any cards here, Wade, they got all of 'em. So they call the shots.
Well... Why don't we...
There's no one else here.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Better than I've ever been in my life.
Yes, sire, strange.  Very strange.
You need to lighten up.
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
Look, this is a bad time...
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I'm just on my way out...
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Nothing.
Chloe's dead.
Do you care?
What do you get out of it?
Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
Marla...
Yes.
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
Pardon me?
And, now it's gone.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
If you could fight any celebrity?
You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
Promise you won't.
Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
Homework assignment.
Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
What's this all about, Tyler?
Why do people think I'm you?
You have jobs.
What about Marla?
This is not about martyrdom.
What?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
... no, no, no...
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
Too much school.
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
I hope you're ready for this.
So let's do it.
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
Do you remember what triggered it all?
I'm not following you --
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
No, I'm good.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
What feeling?
I know, we'll be there soon.
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
Right. April 25th.
That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to.
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
I wish you were on the plane!
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
"Next?"
Huh?
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
I've seen worse places.
No cigarettes.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
Why's that?
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
What's the job?
Not yet.
We just take pictures?
Christ almighty.
About 22 hours on site.
That's a pretty hairy ride.  Full Colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
What that?
Colonel.
There were treating me like a headcase.
This just occurred to somebody, now?
Most men are.
Why this is outrageous!...
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
You still believe in God?
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
It was a crime.
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
Fine.  I'll say no.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
How un-sixties of you.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Free?
Yes.  They're free.
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
<u>What</u>?!
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Parry.
Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Bingo!
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
Sure...
<u>Fag..a</u> <u>fag</u> <u>you</u> <u>say!?</u>... <u>"Curst</u> <u>wolf!</u> <u>Thy</u> <u>fury</u> <u>inward</u> <u>on</u> <u>thyself</u> <u>Pray</u> <u>and</u> <u>consume</u> <u>thee!"</u>
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
I leave it to you.
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think...  "When there's a fire in your heart/Break the glass/Sound the alarm..."
Yes.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
I don't, huh?
Fill it up.
You're lucky no one was hurt.
Where are you going?
Alaska.
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I'll come back when you've made up your mind...
I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
Oh.
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
I guess you fell in the water.
That's dangerous, you know.
You don't call that music, though.
I think it's what you think.
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Shut up...
What?! I can't hear you!
No, the last time was three years ago.
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
You're all full of shit!
I've got an extra jacket behind the seat, if you want to put it on.
Besides being very rude.
No, I wouldn't.
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
Victor.
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
I got punished, man.
She fucks it all up!
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Eddie from Compost?
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
I think she lives down by Pitt.
'Cause you know what, you're not supposed to know but yesterday she lent me her pills for her Moms and if I don't give 'em to her she's gonna die. You want her to die?
I think he's 18 or 17.
Yo, that's my girl.
I'm a good friend of hers.
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
What?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Sonofabitch.
Fletch, this is dumb.
What goddamn right do you have to take him?
I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
There is?
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
You gonna nail the chief?
Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
You may be right.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Ahem.  'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Away. I think it might take you a while to get your life back together. You don't need me around.  Don't go back in there.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
Twenty years.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
I'm all ears.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
You sure those doors will be open?
Not me.
Spot right here.
You doing a story on this guy?
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
I'm sorry?
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
That's a strange combination.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
Down boy.
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Can I ask you a question?
Why'd you let me in?
How come?
Swarthout. Yes. He's the man who sold us the ranch in --
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
Come here.
You shouldn't be here.
They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
Very good, sir.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
She moved out.
So you're saying she moved out.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
You'll have it.
Fletch.
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Please.
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Who?
Did she tell you anything?
But I am...
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Spooky.  I'll process her.
Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice.
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
Let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  Drop us at my place.
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
You're not funny.
Wha --
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
You need it.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Who's my real father, man?
If you're hiding something... oh, oh, I'll have so much fun.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
That's funny, you're cute.
I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Boca?
Got a wife named Angie.
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Yeah?
Hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
Formidable!  Sans toi je m'habillerais encore en docker.  Je suis pass voir Franoise.
Non!
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
Mmm.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
Where from?
Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and I'll knock you into the middle of next week.
Not a chance.
Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.
Toy wit' this will ya.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
For dead bodies.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
Nothing.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
Don't know what's behind it.
Well, why not a little of the King?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
Sure.
Wish you weren't.
Do you know how much I love you?
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Daddy, I'm scared.
I can't believe people are still using these things.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
What?  What is it?
I don't know...  What about the other women?
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
You really wanna know?
He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
Hang on.
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it.
Yeah.  Sure.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
So how are things at the hospital?
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
Drop me off?  How do you mean?
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
We were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  It was either this or an orgy.  Vera chose this.  What're ya gonna do?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
Not now.  I'm cold.
Chuck... look.
I love you, man!
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
A hammock?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
I don't know.
Did you stay here last night?
No.  I got here just before you did.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
Everything's gonna be fine.
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
Uh...yes.  But...
Did you hear me?!
Which is?
Boy scouting.
Please, Sheriff.  You'll see we dug it up.
June the 19th.
It's...It's all right.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
About Jessica.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Jason...Voorhees?
So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
I'm staying.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
After your parents passed away?
I'd love to.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Elliot?
Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
Do we care?
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
She was very evasive.
What are we talking about?
Yes. What are you implying?
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
She's dying.
What?
The Red Sox
In and out of bed.
He will absolutely hate it.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Why do you need a radio?
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
Packs an emotional wallop.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What's sexy?
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I don't know if I can say that.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Get yourself something to eat.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
They're only gonna lose.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
I lost it. I lose everything.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
What am I doing?
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
Then say it.
Matthew.
Because life is good.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
You're out of bullets.
How come?
But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
What color?
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Yes.
A little.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
Is what true?
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Where are you going now?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
Well, he must've found some of the answers...
I thought you were against fighting.
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
I've traveled so far -- and thought so much.  As you can see, my city was a sea city -- always filled with Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jews and Persians.  The temple where you were yesterday is of my family's sect, the Pranami. It was Hindu of course but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita, moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I --
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
So did I.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
No.  But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
Where do we start?
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
Again?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
It's okay, Eugene.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
How long?
Vincent, come down.  I've found him.
There's a way.
Why not?
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Why don't we say we were together?
They found an eyelash.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
There's a problem, Lamar.
You okay?
It looks fine.
Assumed name... Houston.
Good.
I'm still here, Doc.
Better than I remembered.
... and live happily ever after.
Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
And switched keys.
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
I think so... I don't know.
I guess we are.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
What about you?
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
Can't leave the desk.
Just fine.
What's it to you?
You serious?
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
'Good.'
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Why?
Nicer than most.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Really?
We're there now.
Now you're asking.
Expect so.
Nice of you to come.
Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything?
Did you work with him, Keith?
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
It's not like that, luv.
They came back?
What about Keith?
What you doing around here then?
A bereavement. A death in the family.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's all right, Eric.
We've got to take you back to London.
But they have to be diplomatic.
Your hundred, and another hundred.
Three hundred altogether, Harry.
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
Eh?
What?
What hard part?
You fucking build it!  Men come...
What could we get for them?  I don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...I don't know...Hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  All told...must be, I'd... three bucks a throw...I don't know.
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
Yes.
That's right.
For five thousand?
Absolutely.
You went for it.
In the abstract...
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
Because you listened.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
Huh?
...what am I going to do all month...
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
No.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
Yes.
You understand?
In school.
'Cause, you know, 'cause they weren't, I know that Mitch and Murray uh...
Go to lunch, will you...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Levene!!
You have a problem?
The people downtown said...
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
Would you come in here, please?
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
Murray said...
...ah, fuck this...
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
Yeah.  Yeah.
That's alright.
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
How do you know I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
No, I don't think so, Shel.
I'm sorry.
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
I wanted to speak with you about...
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Kenilworth.
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
To change our minds.
That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
What would have elapsed?
And when was that check cashed?
The check wasn't cashed?
It's not me, it's my wife.
What did I tell you?  What did I say about the three days...?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...
Fuck the Machine.
Guess who?
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
Oh, and I don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  Fuck you, Dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "How much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum. 
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
What is this, your farewell speech?
Your farewell to the troops?
They got, listen to me...
Some of them...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
John...
Why do you have to go?
I can help you.
Some day you will.
Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone.
What if we don't pay?
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
I saw him with you.
No, Dad.
Not for strangers; for my country.
The child cannot harm you.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em.  Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
Beautiful.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'
That's off now.
How long does this go on?
It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
Yes.
Yeah, give me a minute.
Two-thirty.  That gives me time to see my boy.
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
She took the Senate Investigation worse.
I know he's in Israel.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
They are everywhere!
No questions.
The room has a bug in it.
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Maybe two, three thousand dollars.
He is, I believe, a brother.
This committee owes an apology!
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Why too late?
Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli?
His brother came to help him.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
On a plane back to Sicily.
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
You're a considerate young man.
However I can help you...
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
So, that occurred to me.
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
No.
After dinner.
Says who?
Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
What are you then?  What will you be ten years from now?  Still cutting lawns?  Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
Then you're as single as I am.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Splendid.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
All right, I guess.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
All righty.  I understand.
I never thought you were.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
I just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  You just said you didn't want me self-conscious.
From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it.  Understand?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
No harm done.
Very sporting of you, Clayton.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
I didn't have the guts for it.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
Not at all.
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
You didn't, Jimmy.
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again?
Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I hire him while you were in the hospital.  He came cheap.
Just go.  We can manage without you.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio.
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Six years ...
What kind of job... ?
A boost. A big boost ...
The business has changed...
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
I knew you'd say that, too --
You got no choice. It's over.
You want to come along quiet?
How's Atley -- ?
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
Your girl works in there ...
Double-meaning intended --
The other day....
Yeah.
C'mon, man ...
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership...  Imagine us selling cars?
Mother -- !
You've been pre-booked...
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
I dunno ...
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
"About what?"
You can handle it?
I can handle it --
The family that steals together, deals together...
Dad'd be proud --
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
No problem -
So I was replaced by Mitch?
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
That's what I want ...
Oh, God...
Hear you roar ...
Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go --
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Hello, Otto ...
You remember Junie?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
Excuse me --
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Billy, how are you?
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Wha?  Me?
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
What bag?
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
And Jimmy's in it, right?
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
No, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. Fuckin' lights and everything!
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
No, and we got four of 'em.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
It's a way outta here.
What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
Why didn't you yoke him?
You caught that, huh?
Well, I don't have no trousers on...
Shut up.
You're walkin' bitch, Will's takin' the car.
Guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. I had to let him help with the car.
Allegedly, what I am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if I had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
Hey, I'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. But as long as you're here I want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
It's touching me.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Building two.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Hey fuck you.
Okay. How?
I think so.
Yeah, when do I get my hypnosis? You guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Thank you, Will. I'll do that.
Yes.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
You too, Gerry.
I been here a couple years.
Who?
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Now wait a minute--
Hold on!
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Sean...
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
There is somebody...
Hold up.
No, but, I mean you know...I do other things. That no one knows about.
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
You think so?
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
This is a real piece of shit.
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
How'd it go?
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
It's not your fault.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
Good luck.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
What?
I swear to God.
Exactly.
When?
Some, a little.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
No.
How do you know that?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, but how do you know?
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Then what are you afraid of?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
But ef you *do* whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
You're *ticklin' me!*
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must a died, too.
Gallon or two?
Okay. Go on.
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Got a warrant?
Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Been out travelin' around?
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
I never heard nothin' about it.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
I ain't gonna run.
Thought you was in jail.
Women is always tar'd.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
I didn't mean nothing.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
Put somepin' over him, so he won't git sun-struck.  Ever'body set now?  Awright, Al, letta go!
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
You mean I can't even get outa here?
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
She'll be awright.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
Sure. Good-by.
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
I know that! But *where* they gone?
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
The rest of my fambly set out for the west--there wasn't nothin' to eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' wouldn't let me. So now I just wander around. Sleep wherever I am. I used to tell myself I was lookin' out for things, so when they come back ever'thing would be all right. But I knowed that wan't true. There ain't nothin' to look out for. And ain't nobody comin' back. They're gone-- and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard ghost--that's all in the world I am.
It's them white things, made outa dish-stuff, like in the catalogues!
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
We can pick anything.
Ain't gonna get outa han'.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
You're so funny...
--Stop it--
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
You're fucking psycho.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
No time.
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
Will you come with me?
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
This is me breating.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind.  I am part of what I call a brain syndicate.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Nope.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
I don't think so.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I've looked at it.
It's a place where religious people--
I spoke to your father the other day.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
Paul?
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
I'm a professional killer.
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
That's up to Pilgrim.
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
What's that to miss?
When I was first married.
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
It is. It's lovely.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
One more time.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
Fine.
Then why do you want to leave?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
Exactly...
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
Yeah. Bye.
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Sing it to me, Frankie!
I love you.
Doing what?
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
You've already made arrangements!?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
How are you feeling about work?
What do you mean?
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
Yes, it does.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Well, of course, right...
- See, what you can do for him --...
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
I want to watch.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
OK, OK.
Oh yeah...
How much longer do you think?
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
I want it.
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Looks like a hacker wrote it.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
It was him, man!
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
What did we learn in school today?
Revenge.
No. No one special.
Watch which friends you do play with. A record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. No future. Exiled from everyone and everything you love.
Razor and Blade.
Burn!
No, you're not in my class.
It's cool, I'm just looking.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Are you challenging me?
Uh, hold on...
What?
Yeah.
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Phreak?
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
Four plus Myers.
No way. No how.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
Do you love me Rachel?
Like a real sister?
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
Just do it.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Got it Ben.
Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
Car trouble?
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
Okay.
He shouts, too.
Saving the treats for Bob?
Yes, you can.
Here, Lester.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
I want to stay here and watch this.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
Could have...
Looks like to me you're just plain scared.
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
There's nothing else I can do.
That's the idea. Here we are.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
And then, uh, April...huh?
Oh, is that what it is?
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
Fast.
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Ed Smythe, yes.
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Yes, I do.
I think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
Everything's okay? 
Well, sure.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
I have been in love with you for so long.
Why, you know the situation.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Why?
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
So?
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
Mom, come out!
No, thank you.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. 
Because I have to!
You've been with someone!
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
I think they're fantastic.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
Really?
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
That's really nice!
Oh!
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Oh, yeah. 
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
Easily.
You got it.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Uh, losers!  All losers!
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
I was so bored!
At least I'm open to new concepts!
I recall you.
People change...you know.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
No, I am.  I am.
Oh, I'm fine.
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Oh, well.
I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Right.
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Hi.  How you doin'?
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
They're offering... 
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
It's a growth business.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
You want me to be?
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
And have <u>you</u> found Peace..? 
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
...are they hard to get?
First things first.
Seen what, sir..?
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
Awright.
'fraid it's too late.
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
...what's he got against you?
I am all attention.
Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
Well, don't you worry, cause that <u>baby's</u> gone take care of <u>that</u>.
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>Studiolo</u>...
That, that was <u>business</u>...
...yes.
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
I've left my <u>program</u>...
Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
...who say...?
...tell them...
Spoken like a Protestant.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
Why should <u>you</u> care?
You're <u>free</u>...
Oh baby, oh baby....
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
Brazilian. 
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Then tell me.
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
For approval.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
Yes.
Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
Thanks a lot. Seriously though, by winning this bet, you will prove to the world that you indeed know everything.  Isn't the rush of gambling on your cynical philosophy of life enough?
Why do you even like me?
I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
"...how important our friendship..." Not that old--Oh God, what have I done?
Iunno.
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Ronnie!
Nice guys finish last. I should know.
I don't know, it was okay, I guess.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
I'll think about it.
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Monday morning, you're history. I'll tell everyone about tonight. Transfer to Washington. Transfer to Jefferson. No one at Westerburg's going to let you play their reindeer games.
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
What do you want from me?
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
No.
Give it up girl!
Suicide is a private thing.
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby.
There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
Chick-en.
Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, <u>Dad</u>?
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Oh come <u>on</u>. Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way.
I was just making it more special.
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
What did your <u>boyfriend</u> say when you told him you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?
Goddamn Geek!
Any contestants worth mentioning?
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
Look who I've found!
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
Can I go now?
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
Open this door!
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Somebody's got to help us!
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
This . . .
God, yes!
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
I'm all over it.
I'm stumped.
You just made that up.
Well?
I understand... I won't-
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
Since what?
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
What?
In a word? Lucrative.
What?
Never to put you in my will.
Really? Why?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
I don't work here.
I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
YOU!
In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
It was you!  I thought I heard...
Same with me, pretending I was you. An impulse.  Why not?  I had this shoe.
How recently?
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!  Well, at least I'm gonna get my goddamn million bucks.  TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
Goodnight, John.
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
John, I know all about it.
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
That too.
He'll do it.  You really-should have talked to him first.
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
She can't quit.
What?
The "unknown hero."  They found his shoe right beside the plane crash.
I... I saw him out the window.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Let's watch some TV.
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
-- institution.
Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll have more to tell me next time.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Who doesn't?
Right.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's probably nothing.
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
What?
Oh -- great.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
He's made some friends, hasn't he?
I know someone else who's sensitive.
Well, what about <u>these</u>?  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u> in your pocket, too?!
C'mon.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
We'll talk in the morning.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
Shut up.
What about cable?
I didn't.
Can we keep him?
Promise.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Talk to me about what?
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
Why?
I already told you.  I took a walk.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
You.
That doesn't matter.
She's a treasure she is.
Do you love me, Conner?
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
I was wondering if I could talk to you?
Are you a cop?
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
I don't know.
Sorry.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
I don't think it is a duplication.
It has to be.
I was working on the cataloging.
Me too.
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
The best.
I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not.
I'm going to my desk.
You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
It's about Mars --
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
There is no way out.
They're fine.
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
Give up, Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
Use more ice.
I got the gasoline --
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
First my girls.  I get my girls, you get the other disk.
You'd better be kidding.
I know.
I can't go without Thomas.
What are we going to do about Mike?
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
He didn't say.
If you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this, but what does he have on you?
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
A delegation.
The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
Leave it to me.
Of course.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Canadian Club?
Their people?
They're only taking the whites.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
Your police are at the gate?
We have decided to move the government to Gitarama.
When?
Today.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
How so.
Why not? We are half way there already.
Thank God.
I saw the sign.
Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
Our cards, please.
Of course.
Move? Where to?
Let's have dinner first.
I tried already. The phones do not work.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Give him time.
I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children.
No! Sit down now.
Paul! Then another voice.
Please do not talk like this.
There is one thing I need right away.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Thank you, Roger.
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Yeah...something.
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
Ms. Marr!
Excuse me?
Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
-- fuck you!
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
Best of a nightmare.
Prove it how?
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
Back where?
That's crazy!
What about that other guy?
He's gotta still be down here.
We're safe?
For chrissake give me a hand!
Jesus!
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
-- the sadistic prick --
Stalking the wild poltergeist.
Question answered.
-- wit...nesses --
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
And then what happens?
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you.
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
He must've beaten us all here!
Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight.
He must've unsealed the room!
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
There's no need to be.
Maybe it was Colleen...
Go to your room!  Now!
Where is she now?
Take me to her.
Sure.  Did you see the others?
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
I don't know.  That's strange.
Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
What's happening!
Before.
Oh, that's nice...
Good night.
I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
What's going to happen?
Oh.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Jesus Christ ...
Yeah, well like you said - it's a mystery.  But that's all it is. Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
What?
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
Would you know this store again?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think the lady just made a sale.
What else came with it?  Anything still here?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
No.  Thank you.
Yes.
Not quite.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated.
My next word was gonna be "consciousness."  Swear to God... tubby.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
There goes five seconds...My record's eighteen.
"You could be swinging on a star."
Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?
Why not just go now?
"But we'll be the same as we started...
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
Uh....old badminton injury.
Oh.  No.
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Wha--
Ah, the mafia, the cops; do I know how to party or what?
Surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference.
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover.  So don't play with me.
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
No.  But why do you let Butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt?
The Circle-o'-Gaiety!
The Hudswinger!
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Oh, is that it!
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Never mind about that...
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
Tell me about it.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Yes sir...
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
Oh my God, sir!
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
If you say, miss.  If you say.
Oh, Mrs. Rand --
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
Thank you.
The West Indies?
Yes -- on the boat.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
Did you hear what he sang?
I've never given it much thought.
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
Insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure, Mr. Holland. But -- as Miss Connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Investigation of what?
Emotion tricks all of us, Mrs. Rand.  And you are a woman with a very strong conscience.  That conscience has been tormenting you. The rest is coincidence.  There is no such thing as a Zombie.  The dead do not come back to life. Death is final.
Overpriced bomb, cost over $6 million -- no stars, and no one's into the horror genre these days anyway. I'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there. It's disaster films that are gonna stay at the top.
Um, yes.
That one.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Ben.
Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
Classes?
Libbets. Libbets Casey.
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Jesus all right enough!
What do I think? I think you're probably touching each other. I think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and I think he's trying to get into your slacks. I think, at fourteen years of age, that you're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
I mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off Janey and Jim, you watch. It's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
With Mikey?
Oh Wendy.
I used to know how to cook.
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
None at all. I'll leave it in front of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.
No need to make excuses --
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
The Idiot?
What is it?
Truly? Do speak.
I'm chewing.
Tell Sandy? What?
Yeah? See ya.
Yeah.
Vodka?
Huh?
Sure.
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Call all of them from here to Anchorage. Tell them we now know that Kay Connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack, but we haven't recovered it yet.  We can get it in by the morning editions.
Why?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
What I saw?
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
Around twelve-thirty.
That's right.
That's right.
What are we thinking?
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
We're under investigation now.  Back in Seattle.  Hap wanted to talk.  As soon as we got back.  Thought he could work out some kind of deal.
You heard me that time.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Long as it's fun.
What was?
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
The phone call.  The knapsack.
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
I suppose.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Drop the gun, Walter.
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
I can't save her.
But you're the fairest by far.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
Stop her Louis!
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Not you my dear.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
Then maybe so do we. Every night of our lives. He was my brother. My maker. He gave me this life, whatever it is.
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
You are more beautiful than any of them.
You are neither, Claudia. Now stop this --
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
Be still!
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
Love?
Never.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
Yes...
NO!!!!!
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
You asked for death. I didn't promise it -
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
Yes. I remember...
You're not lying to me, are you?
What about coffins?
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
And you know what you ask for?
And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
No.
Yeah.
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
Will you try...for me, please?
It's gonna be great.
That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
I'm sorry.
Are you sure?
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
I wasn't dreaming.
Rio, baby!
Yes!
So why are you still here?
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
Drunk again?
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
Thank you, I'll do that. Good night.
They were gore before I came here.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
I think not.
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
She has never mentioned her family.
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
The General  you don't even know him.
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
Theodosia.
Her family name?
I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back pale -- sick -- she died --
And I'm your friend  but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
I can't.
Who?
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
All right  all right.
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Suicide.
Angel, Second Class.
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Oh, wonderful!
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Splendid! Is he sick?
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting  to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Yes, sir.
Will you try to get some sleep?
A cattle boat?
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
I'm all right.
Hmmm?
No.
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
He's pretty young for that job.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Did you get a doctor?
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in  providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
All right, sir.
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
If I told you it might not come true.
How's that?
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
George, darling! Where have you been?
What?
No problem, no problem.
Shut up.
Too hot in the lighthouse?
Listen to Andy, Sean.
The Shark.
Can you get us a line?
Aren't you off-duty?
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
Not the drugstore!
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
Hey, come on....
Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera, see, from underwater, and I didn't know how to get it open, but my brother-in- law, in Montauk, he works at a hi- fi store, and they sell cameras, so he....
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
First things first.
The what?
Probably.
I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal?
Right.
Door's locked.
Mrs. Silvera.
As far as the office.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Because of today?  The beach?
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
What?
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
Sure they did....
Okay, okay, coming....
Anything.  Anything.
Yep.  Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
Is there something I don't know about?
You do everything your parents tell you?
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
Want another one?
Hope I make it through both.
I don't have a choice.
Just put your mask on.
... Friggin' fish.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
Nothing.
Here.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
No, you're not.
... Me, too.
What's up?
It's a shark's tooth!
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Only to myself.
I'm  fine.
Nobody told me.
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
It's one of the world's greatest creatures.
Just watch it when he does.
I like it when they wake up.
And I like you.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Philip.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
Brian, he's coming around!
Ten minutes ago.
Sure.
Yeah, from Boston.
I don't know, it depends.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Yes, it's great!
That?
Thanks.  Bullshot.
No, South Georgia.
Polar bears.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
That bugger moves fast.
But you always let me....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you ever spank him?
No....
She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think....
I like it.  Really....
You caught me....
You make sure they come?
Can't help myself....
Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go.
You could teach...You could....
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
You're always taking time off....
What?
How come it bumps up and down when there's no road?
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
We'll be done pretty soon....
How's Ellen?
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Oh, boy....
We'll pass around cigars....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
They put bombs on dolphins....
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
When I got the grant.....
I hear he flies a lot of private charters....
Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  If he comes back I'll hear him.  You'll have time to get up.
I didn't ask you to....
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
Maybe he only likes white meat....
'Snuck up on me....'
Screw you, Jake....
You jump, you'll kill yourself....
I told you....
I'm training to....
Anything to do before I go home?
Good night, Polly....
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
I hope I'm not intruding?
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
The <u>dogs</u>?
It's a method for quitting smoking.
No, you didn't.
No .. You didn't know that ..
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
Three or four.
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
How come he's suddenly so forth- coming? I'd like to kick him right in the ass. If he'd discussed it with me, I mighta gotten somewhere ..
What are you looking for?
Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, Sergeant. What I said on the phone's the same as I'm saying now. I got no idea where Amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
I don't know.
Of course I would ..
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
Do you pray?
Have you known her long?
Really? What did he say?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
<u>Then explain it to me</u>. I got enough darkness, don't I?
He don't know that. I didn't.
Then why didn't he kill me?
I don't want them to arrest you.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Yes, Sir.
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Ask him.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
One of the accountants.
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Okay, this is working.
It's a plan --  -- _ 51.
Could you just stop moving?
I think you added the "brutal."
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
Now what did you lose?
Oh tsht. Yes.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
It's all going to work.
Call me later, hon.
I'm glad you're home.  That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
-- especially one like this.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Actually he said "glad." _ 85.
Oh good.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Same to you.
Fine, I just --
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Okay... I will...
So this break... is a break-up.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
Please, if I start talking --
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
I'm sorry, I --
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
No.
That's your word?
No tell me. _ 84.
How do I know?
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
No, you're --
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
Damn right.
What --
And say what?  "Please remove your dick from my ass?!"
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
I'm not your brother!
That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
What is it?
A bird cage.
It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.
No, Dr. Grant says...
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
then we should...
What?
Raptors, mostly.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
Mine's new.
We need to head for the coast.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
No. I couldn't see.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
-humidity, I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
I lost everything I came after on this trip, but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff, and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
Can the kid walk?
Where did the vehicles stop?
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Pretty sure.
You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
What kind of park is it?
Dilophosaurus.
- - barfs them up - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  That's what makes her sick.  Good work Tim.
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
Dinosaur eats man.  Woman inherits the Earth.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Oh, imperfections?
Please - - chance it.
Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
- - shut up.
Yes.  It's not a criticism, by the way.
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
Yeah.
Relax Donald, relax.  They're scientists.  They ought to be curious.
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
You got me.
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
Let's get you out.
It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
You're a beautiful big animal.
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
You want to put in chain saws?
That's not true...
I think we're lost.
You have a map.
Help me with this.
Who is this? What's going on?
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
Video store?
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
He wets the bed?
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
You're not going to be there?
How's that possible?
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
Ten minutes...
If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
Even the so-called New Town isn't so new.  Only the people.  People of the future living in buildings of the past.  Has anyone seen Eduard?
Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
Have you worked here long?
Did you?
A man must eat --  And drink.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
In a manner of speaking.
It's my last and final one.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
I'll commit that to memory.
No, sir.
You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
He would have.  You were his best friend.  A better friend than me.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
When I have no reason to doubt.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
I've heard of it happening.
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Eight -- and seven months.
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away, wouldn't they have shut the door as quietly as possible?
What did she say?
You mean because it's been a while since there was a sunny day?  What a good detective you are.
I'm not obliged to give you access, you know -- not without authorization -- but I'll make an exception this one time.
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
You're outta your depth here, Miss Darrow!
I think you're trying to run before you can walk, Ann.
Photography teaches you nothing, Ann! Click! One second and you've seen all you're going to see. I want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... I want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. Understand the carving and you will understand the people! That Ann, is the key to archaeology.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
Well, that was a monumental waste of time! I pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  I made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
You better not slow us down, Denham!
Yeah.
What's compassion, mister.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
I guess he figured it was better.
No, that's not --
-- Yes.
Yes.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Could I ask some questions?
What about everything since?
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
How would I remember?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
But if it's someone else I do.
How?
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
Don't touch anything.
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
They don't scare me any more.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I think you're homesick.  I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.  John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
I'd like to make something clear. I don't go after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Has she talked with you since prison?
Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
I know Tom Grunemann.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
Will she pick me up after school?
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
I'm sorry.
Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
No!
Is that really your chair?
Uh huh...
Bigger than a principal.  The judge sits in robes in a big chair.. The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided...  ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment.  And I'm very lucky.  Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month.
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
Eight, almost nine years.
It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
A heavy drinker?
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
But it's not a year from now, is it?
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Yeah.
No, but--
Mr. Kramer, there's--
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
California?
I told her you're doing a
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear you say that!
Please, Thel...
Do not worry, Holiness. They fight for you. They are under your protection.
Can I do anything I want?
No.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
All?
With much bloodshed.
Time to study.
Cow.
Do I have money?
Please.
Roughly five thousand men.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
I had relinquished doubt.
Thank you.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
Ahh.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
Eliminate you.
We cannot.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
No!!  Out!
I'm laying a spring trap!
I coulda shot you, you--
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
Yup.
The more he thrashes, the better.
Just those two.
That hurt my feelings.
<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
Who?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
I'm sorry but you're...
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Thank you.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
Night.
What?
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
Really--
You calm down!
Well...
He's floating.  Take it home.
Take him.
Hector.  <u>Do</u> <u>not</u> <u>move</u>.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
Look ten feet into the water.
Wait.
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
Kelly--
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
Not yet! - just wait for me.  Maybe in about two seconds.
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
Do you recall my instructions to you, Starling? What were they?
Point taken.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Freddie was so happy for me when I got this job. This - toaster giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit. What did she know, big dummy...
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Because you weren't wasting my time.
Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Horses - and sheep...
I - ran away...
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
Early. Still dark.
What was it?
Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away.
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
Did you breast-feed her?
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Your "father"?
What?!
Thank you so much.
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
There was none!
Some say that's the way of it.
"Some"?
He delivered no such message.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
Fort Edward, then?
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
What did you see, Major?
And what is that?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Thank you. How can I reward you?
Sir!  Upon the center, wheel to the left- about!  March!  Rear ranks, proper distance!  Front ranks, take your distance! March!  Halt!  Make ready! 
Gifts?
Yes.
Yengeese Major give all property to Magua.  Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, many gifts, maybe three, four oxen.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Granted, Monsieur.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
Yeah...right...
...all of you owe time and I thought tonight would be a good time to---
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
You screw around like that again and--
Can't we fix it?
I can't see them!
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
And it killed Bo?
No...she killed herself.
What about his suit?  That's a million five the company's got to replace.  They'll make somebody go get it.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
He's tanking on us...
What are you going to do to him?
...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
Fucking great...You telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on.
Where're the others?
I don't know what you mean.
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Can I help?
They were going to pay, then?
Good job, Chris.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Er well, yes we do.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
What the fuck is going on?
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Out the back.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
And look what happened to that.
Why, what's up?
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?
Tom?
You will what?
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.
What do you mean?
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
They're not going to jail.
I can fix cars.
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Yes, sir--
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Nice job.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
Do I seem jumpy?
Same weight I always was.
So that's him--
Come on in--
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
Well--
So I'm part-Indian?
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
Mikey look at this--
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Take that pair over in the corner--
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Because I'm your father.
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid]
No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
We have a daughter.
Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
You thought any more about our murder?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Right. When he was killed.
A little older than Paloma is now.
Nobody's too busy.
Not if I can help it.
He squeezed money out of you?
And that was the last time you saw him?
Could of been. That was white people's business.
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Time marches on.
Murdered him?
Want to take a walk?
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
The shooter local?
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Yeah.
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
What's up?
I haven't seen anybody come by.
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud.
Sure.
The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella--
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Me neither.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
Why you think that was?
Who is he?
I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
That's so cool.
I know him.  I saw him.
I could scoop them out.
I don't know.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Yes.
Does that mean...?
That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening.
Stuff?
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
I'm here, aren't I?
And they all came...
Yes.
Quaid and Jennifer--
Good.  There.  Yes?
Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann.
No.  I'm not going near him.
New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
--vanished.
I'd like to hear them.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
We've never met.
Are you a gambling man?
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why.
Yeah, I know.
And then... because I was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called Swann
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
At birth.  I don't know you --
For an introduction.
Have you been in?
Or murdered, like Nix.
Will that do?  No?
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
And you're not?
You didn't try hard enough.
What?
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Ok.
You'll do it?
What do you do?
Oh, what do you do with that?
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
See you later.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Can I enter?
I don't think so.
Yes?
Is this a bad time?
It's just carpet.
I don't know.
That's ok.
Ok.
One moment, please.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
She's a talk show host.  They can't be charmed.  By definition.
Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
When did they find her?
Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
Just me.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith.  Where are you in death without it?
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
I'll bet.
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
What do you mean?
Whish the circumstances were different.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
He can see you Thursday.
Peter, you're now writing a book about the Viznick case.  You seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers.  I have to ask, how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day, face to face with alleged killers?
There weren't any voices.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
Parents died?
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Maybe she is.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Are you okay?
Careful.
Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
Why not?
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
No one's forcing her.
You were trying to make me look bad.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
I don't.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Yeah.
None of your business.
That what you think?
Fine, Quincy.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
Right here.
The "man" again.
What the hell's going on?
Least you got your priorities straight.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Yup.
Funny.  I never did.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Thanks.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
He tore his ACL.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
I ain't a damn liar.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
No.
Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
Brain and Lung.
Oh, she's fine.
No.  No.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
No one else in there with you?
Did you hear what I said?
Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
Who was it?
Bit messy.
Yeah.
The gentleman who came to the door --
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Yes.  I will.  It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
You really use strong language.
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
I'm sorry.
What?
I've got troubles.
Yes.
Ready to go,go,go?
-- Richard.
I don't know, Richard, they need to talk it over --
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I'm almost done.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
What?
Gently, son --
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
Braces.
Braces?
Don't do this, Don.
I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal --
Do you wanna sit down?
I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil?
I'm trying.
She loves you.
You got it.
Who are you gonna call?
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
Is that still lingering?
I would just want to clear some things up:
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
It's all important --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
-- fuck you.
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
He's in here --?
yeah.
There's no disturbance.
Marcie.
I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
Will you say my name?
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I'm drinking.
It'll take the pain away.
Rose, I don't --
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
I don't.
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
...No....
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
Yeah.  She's sleeping now, I mean --
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
What does that mean?
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE <u>INDECENCY</u> TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --
Ok.
Yeah.
I didn't know the answer --
...what...?
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
This happens....this is something that happens.
I understand you saved my son's life today.
M'lady...?
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Come, we have a boat waiting.
Tomorrow.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
You can't do it.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
But why?
Well... Well... Okay.
Why didn't you say so?
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
Raoul, no... You cannot do this.  No matter how your heart is broken --
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
A personal nature?
Silence!  I order you!
Yes, your Majesty.
Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
It's lovely.  It's just...
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
We're by Ozone...
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
I didn't hit shit!
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
It's just...catching up with me, you know?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Seattle.
No...
Figure you would have tried it already.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
What exactly did you see?
What happened with the tape?
Well where are ya, what are ya, drunk?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Yeah...
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
I'm going to need a way to get there.
Are you a regular there?
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
Screw him!
Nahhh...
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
Could he handle a direct contact?
At the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
Not the Bible?
Get him to Atlanta.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
What's it narrow down to?
What's that?
What?
How far away's the back-up?
Three minutes.
When do you need it?
Tonic will be fine.
No!
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
According to you I'm a sexual failure. An animal, you said.  You know now, don't you?
Are you a man?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Absolutely,
Uh... sure...
She'll be in, in the morning...
Atlanta and Birmingham.
Let's get straight who we've talking about.  Are you the man I'm interested in?
He's right-handed.
That's true.
I don't want to do that,
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
No.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Hey, baby! Where are you?
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
Is Crawford going with you?
I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me?
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
Lt. Fisk said...
Yeah...
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
How?
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
You're very tan, Will.
Kevlar Second Chance.
I hope you have a second chance...
No.  Caspiar.
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Hi... am I late?
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
You don't know the real me.
You're a wimp.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!
No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I want this show to be positive!
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Are you sure?
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Bob, Andy needs to RELAX.  See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special.  Something nice...
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
Where?
Why isn't he MOVING??
"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
And you are?
Should Tank I.D. it?
It's Choi.
That's what you think.  They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream.
No!
Midnight watch.
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
Shit!  Apoc?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
No.
What does that mean?
You've never used them before.
Yeah.
How does she know?
What did she tell you?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
What vase?
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
We think you're bugged.  Try to relax.
Is it?
I don't know.  It just went dead.
There has to be something that we can do.
You can't!
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
No, you're not.
It's a city?
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Where is it?
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
I'll be all right.
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
You sure?
And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
'And with your spirit.'
How do you know?
Hide the gun.  Throw it away. Anything.  Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean?
No.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
Good idea.
Ok, how's everything going?
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
Yeah, where's the rest?
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Chinese food?
You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh?
Oh yeah...didn't read it but I saw the movie...Gregory Peck...pretty good.
Here.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable.  The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared.  Not half as much as we were though.
Watch your language.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
You could say that.
You ate?
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
I know you do, darling.
A name?
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
You mean this, sir?
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Drew, you're out of line.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.  I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already.  Need any help with the details?
Then why did you bring it up?
Yes.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
How nice for you both.
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Sure.
What are their feelings?
Don't you want to hear the details?
I don't think they're ordinary.  I love keychains.
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Yeah.  Neat.
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
But I didn't mean to do it!
Make it time.
Nuthin'.
You loved back?
She knows how she feel.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Hi, Jennifer.
Love.
Oh yes, I do.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
I came to see you.
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Nowhere?  I'm...here.
Will it?
Yes, that's why I said it.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
It's all yours.
Well...I don't know.
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
You were just curious?
Um -- not right now.
That's okay.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
Yes?
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Those were my words, Bill.
Does she know where she's going?
An offense --
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
It just occurred to me --
What do you mean?!
Just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity, I've been around that long, but it's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest.  Call it boredom, the natural curiosity of me, the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you.
How's that, Quince?
Bontecou Day.  Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
Yes, I believe I do.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Does Drew tell you everything?
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Aw, you're tough.
Nothing.  I'm sorry.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Yes, but --
You and 'Honey'?
When was I in here?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
Why?
Yes.
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
Yeah. You?
Kill him.
I'll go see him.
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
I don't remember. See, I have no short-			* term memory. It's not amnesia -				   *
How do you know about me?
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
So why did you come here?
She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
You've read it a hundred times.
The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Why?
Like what?
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from?
I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"...
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
No, you don't, Jim.  'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves, progress reports and bullshit.
Where's that?
Exactly.
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
When?
It still is.  I'm so in this, I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
And what do I do with him?
What'd Neptune tell you?
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
On my way back...
Verdado where?
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
What are you talking about?
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
What's it say?
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Jos doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
"Future" of...?
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
You sure you heard what I said?
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
You sure are a pretty lady.
I know. Scribbage!
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
For what?
You inviting shee-it.
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
You wanna know the truth? You dumb bastard, I got it for you. Look at it. Goddam thing's ten sizes too big for me.
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
I don't even want you to go. Whaddya think of that? I got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he's God's gift to women. One twenty-buck trick and he's already the biggest stud in New York City. It's laughable.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
You're what?
Hell, don't cry about it!
I'm going to Florida.
You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
Is he all right!
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
We go through the wall?
Yeah. How's Mom?
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car.
Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
Be tough on 'em.
Thank you.
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
What?
ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it.
What?
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Weird shit...?
Track bunnies.  Rats.  They're usually around.
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Depends.  You got a memo?
Don't get kinky here...
We?
No such thing, baby.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
I can.  We can do this...
Oh, Jesus.
Sure.
--my number one fan.
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
I don't know.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
Great.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
No, just the paper will be fine.
Don't be silly. Of course you can.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, "I 'gotta' know will she live," "I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer." "I gotta see how this chapter ends." You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you.
Yeah, yeah...
...have to wait.
Have to wait.
Oh...
Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
It's perfect.
Be my guest.
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
Paul, this will be our legacy.
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
Work, work, work.  Virginia? When was that blizzard?
What? What is it?
Answer me a couple things?
If I can.
Newspapers?
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
Sort it all out.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
And six billion in the world.
I'd like a little more conviction..
Can you think of a better one?
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this?
Then feel better!..
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Have you met them?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I'll muddle through.
It's going to be okay.
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
Brave girl.  If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice.  But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her.  After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law.  And Hunt.  However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera.  Bring it back alive.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
Well, Hunt, what are your plans?
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
..not in time to save him.
No.  After you've lived with <i>Chimera</i> for twenty hours, nothing can save you.  Not even...<i>Bellerophon.</i>
I'm fine..
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
What about him...?
But why tell us?
Good idea.
Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
We got it.  On your feet.
I want to sleep.  Can I sleep here.
Walk, just walk.  Start walking.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Roger that.
What happened to Jim?
What?
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who is they, who is they?
We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you.
They knew we were coming.  Golitsyns dead too.  The disk is gone.
Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
Yeah.  I follow you.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
Then what am I doing here?
I guess.
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Of course I can hear you.
This wasnt what we discussed.
Connection denied.
The Shawfish?
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
You're welcome.
You're not sleepy?
What's your news?
I didn't give you away the first time.
Maybe.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Yeah.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
He's in Palermo.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
Just Johnny.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Take it easy.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
What?
Yes?
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
Alright.
How near is she to death?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Who is he?
If I marry you my mother will die.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
Your hair's different.
Oh God, that's too bad.
You should think about this.
Talk to him.
Did you see the moon last night?
Where is she?
It's late.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
Yes.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
What do you do?
I think it's because they fear death.
Yes.
Marriage is happy news.
Look.
Cosmo.
I don't know.
You see that moon last night?
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Through ... We found them.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
What?
Oh!
A what?
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
Then you shall die.
Come, Patsy.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
It's The Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! | |  At that moment there is a yell and a scream OUT OF VISION.  ARTHUR turns. | |                              ARTHUR |      Who was that? | |                              HECTOR |           |      It was Sir Alf. | |                              ARTHUR |      I didn't know we had a Sir Alf. | |                              HECTOR |      He was feeding it bread. | |                              ARTHUR |           |      Well, that was a very silly thing to do.

I warned you!
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
Bloody peasant! 
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
The nose?
What is your name?
I don't know that!
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Oh, I see,  Right.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
Back to your bed!  At once!
You got my note!
Don't say that word.
Stop saying it.  AAAArghh! ... I've said it ...
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
Out of my way!
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
I need a man who knows where I am.
Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
The greasy pole.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Mrs Brown.
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
I don't know, ma'am.  He was observed earlier, I believe.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Of course, at once.
No.  I shall be out walking.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
He is sick, ma'am.
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Yeah, who isn't.
Maybe he's not dead.
Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Funny.
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
Laurie's.
I was afraid you'd say that.
Yes I am...
I know.  It sucks.
Don't even say it.
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
Got it.
There...
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
I'm thinking!
Yes...but...how did you...
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
They fired everyone.
Who fired everyone?
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
Well, I ...
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Right. See ya.
What?
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
But you won't.
Can you tell me what happened?
I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
How do you remember how to talk?
No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
No.... I don't...
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Thank you... thank you very much.
No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Unreal ... so, you're looking good. Whatcha doin' these days?
Yeah, that's a funny story.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
No one has a gun to your head.
What's going on ?
Please don't be alarmed, Ma'am.
We wait. This is an elevator.
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
Then you didn't give him any passwords of any kind ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
I told him not to sit down in there.....
Knock yourself out.
In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
Yes, sir Mom. 
But, he's...
When you are ready.
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
He probably has a history of this shit.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Fire the whole division.
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
Zach, how old are you, son ?
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
Zach, my boy ! How is tonights adventure going ?
Better, sir.
We have new "guests" for the park. I have a file on them. May I see Bruce ?
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
We can't.
Of course, this one's a gimme. Just be patient, even Ol' Bruce can't outwit some of these traps.
I think I'll see hat action.
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Yes.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
Sure.
Shut up ! It's me.
Where are we ?
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Totally groovy huh?
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
You mean, you knew about me?
Does she?
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
That's okay.
O.K. Thank you very much.
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
I don't need you to be telling me to...
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
Part adventure...part miracle.
They're great.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
I should do this myself.
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
He was caressing.
Phil for God sake.
There's plenty of fruit.
Something wrong?
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
I bet your mom sang to you.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
I like to buy off all the railroads.
Stiffs??
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
I'm sure she will.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
No, why?
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Good.
I'll second that.
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing.  All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle..... 
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
No, sweetie, not yet.
He was allergic to bees.
Why?
Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
Will you tell her I came by?
Sure.
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
He likes her.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
My ball, I lost my ball.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
No, I'm divorced.
Sure.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
Have you ever tried any?
Come here, sit down.
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
If I do it, can we go?
Heaven.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
No, I'm hiding out.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Like they do on TV?
Close your eyes.
Well, let's spit on it.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
Kindred spirits.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
The man you love.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
Can you watch the road?
... you hate weddings, you never go.
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
I've missed a step.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
... whatever is manly and independent.
Gold nose hair clippers.
Exactly.
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
W...
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Till the gas ran out.
No.  I've got you.
The night we met.
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
I came here, looking for her.
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
Well, that just happened that time.
What do you have to buy?
I won first prize.
Go to the King Of the Road and thank her.
Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Your job, huh.
He has that sign with the tree.
Barbara Jean.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
To the bathroom.
It's the den mother.
How'd you get in here.
Let me see if I can get the doctor hold on one second.
No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
He is just wonderful.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
Need a ride?
Do you carry door handles?
What kind?
I feel really good.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
I don't think so.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Yes, it is --
Well, can you tell me why?
About three years.
No, I don't.
Do you like him?
Who is this?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
What?
I've got a gig tonight.
I have to go.
I can't.
I'm twenty-eight
Oh.
What...?  0h, yes.
Yes.
You're real favorites of his.
Where are you going?
Come on.
Hello.
Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
Is that good?
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
Are we in a big hurry?
What he said. We didn't know jack shit about and riot. It just happened. It was kismet. We didn't even know those people. How are we supposed to organize a riot when we've been in fuckin' isolation for the past year? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits.  I mean, it's not like we care. If they wanna say we masterminded the whole thing, let 'em. It won't exactly keep us up at night. But you said you wanted the truth, and the truth is we were just lucky.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
I can appreciate that.
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Oh my God!  Sorry.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
That's indescribable.
Says the United States of America.
Out front.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Yes.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
The entire wing?
How 'bout Mallory?
Tomorrow.
Why?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
What are we talking about?
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
I can't do that. Five guys.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
Everybody givin' it away free, huh?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
You in a big hurry, boy?
All right, then. All I want you to do is tell these boys here you didn't mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
I'll smile when it's funny.
So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
Where's Wilma?
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
Okay.
How 'you doing?
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Guess so.
Went to college, huh?
That's right.
I like a place with lots of life.
What is it?
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
No, on the porch.
Why did you?
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Goin' to see my kid.
Yeah. Well, I do.
What's he like?
Your boy.
What happened, Duff?
Yeah?
Don't call them that.
He could live with us.
You will.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
About ten dollars.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Well, that'll be the first time.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
I don't think that'll happen.
Sorry.
She don't look no worse to me.
Okay.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Oh yeah?
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Well, I got married to one of them.
Shut up, Will.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Omar--
Omar, listen to me--
Of course.
What about her?
He's a vat grown Ninja, the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him, he's no joke.
How's the villa's security?
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
I don't have a girl.
Maybe so...
Nobody has.
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
What are you talkin' about?
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
What's my end?
What's that supposed to mean?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
...Yeah, but the Hosaka's history.
For Peter, that's a short trip.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
You stood for like a month.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
Hey--I can be out of control.
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Oh. Right.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
Is that true?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Really?
I love the way she writes.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Do you think you'll find her?
Yeah, actually I do.
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
Thank you.  I'm Rob.
Everybody knows about--
Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
Can't you make other creations?
Experiments?
It's getting there.
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Yeah, why?
Who told you to choke up that way?
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
Just watch me.  If anything weird happens - like if I start dreaming weird or try to walk out of here, you gotta try to bring me out of it. his me over the head if you have to. Just don't let me leave.
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
We must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans' hospital.
I know it's warm...  I wish you'd call someone to check out the air conditioning, Ken.
Fine.
All of them.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Wait and see.
To old friends.
Yes.  I'm going to see her tonight.
I -- I think so!
We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Nancy...
You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors.  In a way.  All severely sleep disordered.  Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
Then maybe you're ready.
Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis.
Anything?
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Who would know where they were hidden?
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
What?
I come from time to time.  When I'm needed.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
I'm a vegetarian.
Thanks.  Well...
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
Okay.
That's fine.
Why?
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
Why?
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
My son's name is Johnny?
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
No.  What's that?
Right.
Okay.
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
How do you think I'm doing?
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
But... wait... there are things to say.
Hello.
Thank you.  Shall I...
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
Who is it?
Rufus.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Does the girl have a name?
Crazy.  Go along Bayswater...
Yes, I think that one may be.
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Yes.  What do you think?
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
Well, thanks, that's great.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Ah... yes, enormously.
'No comment' means 'yes.'
Do you ever masturbate?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
How about Miss Flintstone?
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
Well... wait for it...  First there's this one...
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
What?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
No -- you're right.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
Who? Tell me!
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
So do I!
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
Welcome back.
Thank you, ma'am...
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
Stand aside, son. Any more takers?
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
Yeah, well, let me tell ya somethin'... While I was up there gettin' in-lightened, I came up with one hellava plan...
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
What? Where?
That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
Let me see your hand!
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Hold it!
When?
'Kay!
You look pretty healthy to me.
I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Okay. How you doing?
He's in charge.
Ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
Yes, ma'am...
What's that?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
Well, I'm running a risk by letting you in, Miss. You know I'm runnin' a risk of gettin' my black ass fired. If you understand what I mean...
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
What for?
Seriously.
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
Yes.  We did.
Exactly.
Oh no.  Do you?
Dwayne?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
But Faith--
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
That was before I found out what it was.
Right now?
Oh, and I forgot to tell you.  He's here with his mother.
Hi.
Well, good.  Good for you.
The Boston Pops.  Season tickets.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
In that case... no...
Any night.
Really...
How about the other one?  His friend.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
But somebody wrote those songs.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
No.
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
Nothing.
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
What's she saying?
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
Because I'm the one who's single.
I never even got to be single.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
And then what, Faith?
I know, but...
Is Damon Bradley here?
Yes.  He is.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Giovanni.
I can't tell her.  She's called off her wedding.  She'll never speak to me again.
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
And you didn't tell her?
Mania.
Sorry...
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
It'll do.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
Then don't.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
That's right... .
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Maybe.
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Terry... Terry... .
You training to be a nun or something?
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
How do you like that one?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
You... .
Don't tell me don't tell me!
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened I'm frightened.
Are you sure they're your friends?
I don't want to hear it in there.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
Give me that gun.
Father, one thing you got to understand. On the dock we've always been D 'n D.
But you still hold out for silence?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Listen, kid, why don't you go home before Johnny... .
Aw, Johnny... .
Nothing happened, Johnny.
What do you mean?
One little dime you don't need.  I know you you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint  only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
Keep Charley out of this.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
Nolan... .
Leave her alone, I tell you!
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I would have time for my own pleasures!
Oh, if there is only time!
Live ones where only the dead should be?
We don't know of anything, Master...
Aaaahhhh.
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
And the one driving the other car?
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Yes.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
She's coming with us.
You're right.
He knows where she lives?
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
How long you talk to her?
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
And then they'll kill 'em.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
What'd you talk about?
Karen.  Where are you?  I been trying to get a hold of you.
Daniel.  Listen --
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
That's all I wanted to know.
The manager's door is metal.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Wait.  You not Adele?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Oh-kay...
There a problem, Foley?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Glenn didn't tell you?
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
I wasn't asking permission.
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
You don't act like it.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
I can go to the bar.
Love it.
Well, does it make sense to you?
It would be worth the risk.
You believe that?
Outside Adele's.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
I'm not angry, Richard.  In fact, I'm completely relaxed.  Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
Islamic.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Gee, I wonder why not.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be.  It's wide open.
You not with probation, one of those?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Your dog was killed?
I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
We don't get to talk much any more.
What'd I say?
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
Not at all.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Not so fast, Dick.  Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Yes Sir.
Hale-what?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
Then why are you looking for her?
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
Come on!
What's there?
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
Sorry to trouble you.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Win?
You too, 'Mam.
Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
Learn English, then!
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eightysix.
I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
Why wait?
Good.
Right. I promised my mother.
Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
But what has to be different?
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Have a nice day.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
I hate chickens.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
What's that?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
Give me some credit, will you?
Sixtyforty.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
Uh... no. You just... look different than you sounded on the phone. Please, come in.
It sucked.
All set.
Just until he heals up?
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
You think he'd believe it if he did?
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
What's wrong with your face?
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
You're not going to like this. Please try to smile...
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
If you'd lost confidence in me, why did you give me the Kronos suit?
Nine.
Continue.
Rayisha. Very nice.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Beckett?
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
Want to hear my favorite aria?
What impressed you about him?
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Do you take risks?
No.
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Where's Dad?
Is that a question?
Yes.
Right.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: "I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to <u>breathe</u> on me?"
Have you changed your aftershave?
My lettuce is wilting.
Night, honey.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Now that you mention it...
I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Beckett?
Andy, you don't want this.
Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns.  Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Entered our minds.
Saw something I didn't like.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
What, you're afraid?
I can't....I can't....
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Only around humans.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Shut up.
I assume he licked it clean.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
How many?
Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
What the hell's it matter?
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
We're all on the same hajj now.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
Taylor, you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
It's probably wrong --
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
Try telling them our names.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Read it yourself.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
What is this?
A hearing.
Maybe not.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Like you, I find it difficult.
What?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
...See them go down? Like fuckin' target practice man, fuck you Charlie!! Ho Chi Minh sucks dead dick!... Crawford! 
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Out there man - behind the log.
No!
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
No... I move faster alone. 
Well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. How you gonna talk to civilians man? People back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what I mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Sheeit, beats burning hutches anyway...
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
How careful should I be?
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
Possibly, Miss.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
Much too late.
Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
That's all there is.
I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
Nothing matters.
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
My father died in jail, and he was twice the man I am.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Ale. I don't mind.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
You must come from pretty far South.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
That's my hard luck--I'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
I can't answer that.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
You asked for it.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
What's a buzzer?
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
You nasty, sardonic--
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
I'm an Irishman, sir.  An Irishman is always logical.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
So the shell ought to have gone over?
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
I'll know when I find it.
You can find out.
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
I am a fool.
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
He checks too.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
She's a suspect, naturally.  But not the only one.
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
You're a young man.  You're romantic.  You think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. You think a soft voice means a soft heart.  You'll grow out of that.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
She is much younger than I am. That's something I'm going to have to get used to. Isn't it, Larry? They'll all be much younger than I am. Here.  Tear them up.
How long have you had it?
Years, why?
In that case, there's someone here I'd like to introduce to you. Over there.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
She'll be here next weekend.  Why don't you come too, James?  I'll                       * show you the marshes properly.  If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
We'll see you next week, and if--
Very good.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
I won't introduce you all by name. Basically James, this is our UK sales team.  What was I saying? Yes, these graduate trainees...
Thank you.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
And I didn't like that man.
Both dead.
Too late.  Just my luck.
Well, you should.
Oh yes.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Hello.
Why not sit down and wait?
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
Dad.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
A flaw I'm working on.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
SHIT!!
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
Zero distortion, sir.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Meaning you were expendable.
What?
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Who's our back-up on this?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
We're not going.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
What's that, General?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
Who indeed...
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
You looking' for some company?
Yes.
Sure.  For five bucks.
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
What motel you staying at?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
You're joking.
What's your name, lover.
Exactly.
Can I have some chips?
No shit.  They expensive?
What are assets?
I'm in town until Saturday.
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
Ready to stomp sod?
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
It felt good.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Do it.
And some of it's mine.  Edward, his jugular's exposed.
Hear me out.  I've known you a long time.  I see a difference in you this week.  Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
I'm up.
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
He's not gonna want us.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Yeah.  I just got it.
Dummy.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
What?
I... Edward...
But what if they serve soup?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
So it's to be torture.
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Should I be?
Brides often are, I'm told.
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
Of course you will.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
Gently.
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
You never said anything about killing anyone.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Have you any money?
Has it been fifteen minutes?
What is it?
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Shall we track them both?
The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
I swear it will be done.
There we cannot help you.
Not yet.
No.
Stop saying that!
Sheesh! I never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Good. Then pour the wine.
Australia.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
A good hour. Yeah.
Congratulations.
What are you saying?
Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation.  How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock.
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
Yes, it's quite possible.
One night.
Aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  So, in order for the scheme to work, we'd have to find a sure fire flop.
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
How's this? 
You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I'm a nothing.  I spend my life counting other people's money -- people I'm smarter than, better than.  Where's my share? Where's Leo Bloom's share?  I want, I want, I want, I want everything I've ever seen in the movies!
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
Here I come, ready or not.
Rudolfo, you dirty pig!  Pull over.
The Blue Max...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
We can't... we keep our money there!
No.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Of which morning?
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
How much?
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
Like what?
Where?
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
I ought to call the police right now!
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
An hour! Or less!
Without calling me?
Does that mean we can't...
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
We could laze around here a while longer.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
Can you?
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
I have to go, Sam.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Only my share.
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Alright, Miss... 
Please... I'd like to go...
Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
Norman took a wife?
Arbogast.  And after he left?  No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been going out there?  Well, I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
Haven't any.
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
That's it. You get it quick.
But where do the rats come in?
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
Do you have many patients, doctor?
I'd like to have a look.
Yes!
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
Well, that's got nothing to do with this case. Can I handle this my way?
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Let it go.
No foolin' -- any suspect?
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
You're insane.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
What was her name?  The one I met.
What?
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
Well, I got to see her.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
What did you expect?
But I'm curious, Rose.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I?
I sure hope you don't.  I gotta get outta here, good night.
I said I wouldn't.
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Five hundred rabbits?
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite.  I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
Well, it's not very plain.
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see --
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
A wonderful woman, boy.
Of course.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
What time is it?
I don't see any bruises or broken bones.
No reason at all, darlin'.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
He's a polecat, dear.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Oh, no, sir.
What's the use, there ain't none.
Well. What kinda job is it?
Your baby?
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
Well, no, I didn't actually.
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
I was going to tell him.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
You think it's that good?
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
Again.
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
Lay off once, would you?
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
I can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
Well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
It's go time, Billy-B.
What was I supposed to do?
How come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
Can't you say something nice once?
There probably is.
We've got the tape to prove it.
You going rogue on me?
Can't I?
Murderer?  Really?
Whatever goes bang.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
I'm well aware of that.
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Leia!
I don't know.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
You love him, don't you?
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Proper?!
We shall double our efforts.
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
He might be.  I don't know.
Uh huh.
For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Weiss.
I hope so my darling.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
I didn't make him for you
Was all I had to say
Now I
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
It doesn't bother me either.
Yes.
I don't think I belong here.
It's okay.
Could ya take off that hat.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
...Yes --
Is everything all right?
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
...Stop jivin'!
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on.  Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
Very high an' very fast.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
No dollar.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
Few minutes?
...Ten minutes.
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Did you hear what I said?
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
...Did ya fight last night?
...Who'd ya fight?
Think about it.
When was they here?
Freak luck for sure.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Please, kid.
...Shrewd.
He ain't losin' nothin'.
Yo, Paulie.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
You ballin' her?
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
What can I do about it?
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight, it's theirs.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive, Mr. Valiant, because they'll have to.  And when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
No...
Does it hurt?
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
Aren't you the lucky one...
Aah!
If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
Yeah...
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Why, what is Tybalt?
In love?
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
He shall be endured
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
She'll not come down tonight.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
I have.
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
You kiss by the book.
Well what shall I swear by?
If my heart's dear love--
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
Meaning, to court'sy.
A most courteous exposition.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
This is important.
Do you really think so?
You know it is.
Is that right?
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
I thought I did.
Nothing.
From Interpol?
Once.
We weren't real thrilled about it either...
That's right.
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
He's company.
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
I do, I do...
Not exactly.
Did he bring that with him?
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
I don't think so.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
Because that's what I would have done...
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
Do what?
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
You think?
I don't know...
Why are you driving?  You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads.  Why are you driving?
No you don't, and you know it.
I think not.
Because I don't walk away.
That's a good question.
You slept with the fucker!!
Why don't we step into my office...
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
Well, I don't know.  I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
I...I can't do that.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
It's NOT too late!
I'm all ears.
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
I know.
Are you sure you're OK?
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
I know.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
You said that, I didn't.
How about you give us what you have and leave.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Lingerie...
We are having a sale on some items over here --
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Yeah...see you at three.
I don't know...
Forget it.
Dwayne -
Is that the mail?
That's great Earl!
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
How much is that?
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
You bring American money?
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
I'm calling for back up!
It's my job!
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
I cannot go to LA...
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
You sound like that all the time.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
It's a long story.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
No.  It was my singing.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
What did you say?
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
What's a Chinese heaven?
Mind your own business.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Are you serious?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Follow me my Asian brother.
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
I'll give it my best shot.
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
The Plaza Hotel?
A little Mu-shu.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
I'm fine.
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
You must come with me for questioning.
Ricky Tan?
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
I know, but --
Tell me about it.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Witnesses.
No.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Stool pigeon.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
It happens.
Who does not know War?  War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  What is it good for?  Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.
Good God, ya'll!
I am from outa town.
I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
I'm sorry.
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
It's called a dress.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
He is the situation.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
What are you talking about?
Can I speak with her?
Han?
He is very good.
He is already on the plane.  I hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
I'm not running.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
God bless you, Maggie.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
We'll rub.
"Nothing but net."
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
Thanks.
Oh, I will.
Tootaloo.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point?
Five hundred.
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
I don't and I don't think you should...
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
That's called changing your mind.
A little longer for me.
So, we'll...
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
I'm listening.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Lighten up, what?
Okay.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
Even when you were young?
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
No.
I told you.  Nothing --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
No.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
I love the symphony.
No, I know that part --
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
A sense of humor.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
Walter and I are engaged!
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
The one in the street.  I chased after you.
No.
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
And you're worried about him.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
I don't know --
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
What's tira misu?
You'll find out.
I don't get it.
There's somebody on the phone for you.  His name is Sam.
What?!
Oh, you're changing your mind --
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Somewhere in the middle.
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
This is not how you do it.  You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
What was?
Is that what she used to sing?
Like do you believe in heaven?
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore.  She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day.  On top of the Empire State Building.
It's only ten o'clock.
Jonah!
Okay.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
It's a short word.
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
Get out.
Okay.
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting.
You look good yourself.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
It isn't right, she says. Was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
What has it got me, your union?
There's Jenkins' wife. You don't see her on no picket line.
Be still ...
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Me, I'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- Montana, Colorado, Idaho. But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don't count in the Anglo locals either.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
No. New York.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
No, Why?
I'll see you tonight.
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Come on, cheer up. It could be worse.
Leave me out of this.
I can't.
Why not?
You really need to lighten up.
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
I don't want to.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
I know a guy.
I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Pull your pants down.
Big Bill.
Just some buddies.
Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
What?
Don't be. I'm worried about the kid.
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
Jesus.
I thought you'd be happy.
Yeah.  What about him?
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
You mean the menacing red car?
There's no motels around here.
That is so unfair.
Don't we always take good care of you?
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
What is it, drugs?
In West Fork?
What about the Captain?  Where's he from?
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here.  Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
Some.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
The Germans do.
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered.
That's not what we're here for.
Since when have things been normal?
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
I'll do my best.
Sure, Reiben.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
Here they come.
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
Sir, if the Krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Twenty-four-five.
Pardon me?
What's the profile?
How can you, how can you say that?
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
I'm sorry. Sam had to do a new crown, we had [?], and Jason had a sore throat.  Your big graduation, and no one was there.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
I still am.
That's not even a scam.
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Hang in there, man.
See you tomorrow.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
You're an inspiration Lloyd; you should go on the seven hundred club or something.
You know I just sit here listening, and you never let me talk.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
He'd like to start serving immediately.
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Crash paranoia.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
So am I. I want to see you again.  I want to see you as much as I can before you leave.  I said it.
Then call me tomorrow.
Mmmm.
Okay, bye, I will.
Okay, bye.
Yeah.  With potential.
You're cold.
It was wonderful.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
How can I look at you and say this?
What's wrong?
It sounded like you did.
Then don't do it.
What do you want?
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...
I know
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right?  That's gotta be a good thing.
Your car?
No way.
Hey.
Yeah.
You know Diane Court?
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Klaus Tauber.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
It's good business.
You're not telling me something.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
That's great.
It kind of looks that way.
So I'll talk to him about it.
Do what?
Christmas presents.
Oskar -
Are you losing money?
What other point is -
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
Yes.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
No.
What now?
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
Why aren't you there?
Why would you wanna do that?
I live here.
I don't think that's a good idea.
What do you want from me, Cotton?
It helped me realize one thing.
And much richer as a result.
She dumped me.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
Over here.
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
It's good to see you involved.
Oh my God.
I have to watch rehearsal.
What?
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
What about rehearsal?
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand?
Well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
A note?
Please, call me Gale.
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
No.
Sid, get in my car. You're coming back to the station with me where it's safe.
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Show him.
Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
Sure.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
Oh shit it's my cell!
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
No.
W-what do you want?
Odds are -- she'll miss anyway.
Oh it did?
What's that?
It's been a year since she died.
You don't still think it was me?
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
Who is this?
Why don't you want to talk to me?
Uh-huh.
Just some scary movie.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
I want to now who I'm talking to.
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
I believe you...
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Then he dies. Right now.
Come on. It'll be fun.
I'll even give you a warm up question.
Afraid not.
I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer.
No, not yet.
Should I be worried?
Casey? Casey?
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
Yes, that's right.
I owe you shit.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Why would she lie about it?
Who are you?
Oooooh... before or after he sliced and diced.
Twice.
She's the Scream Queen.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English.
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Just like old times, ain't it?
It's alright. I'll get it.
You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
No way.
Hey, go easy, Tatum. He didn't do it.
For once, Stu, drop it.
What am I? The beer wench?
Hey, guess who's here? It's that chick from INSIDE STORY?
Give it to me.
So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
I know what you're thinking, okay?  You don't want to get in bed with this every night, but it's different now.  You're retiring.  In six days you're all the way gone.
No, I haven't heard.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
It's always been like this.
Really?
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
It's going to be flawless.  People will barely be able to comprehend it.  It will seem almost surreal... but it will have a tangible reality, so they won't be able to deny it.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
Actually, if it's all the same, I'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p.  Seeing how we don't have much time for this whole transition thing.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
Not here.
I realize that.
Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
I'm fine.
We need a warrant.
No point in arguing anymore...
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
I'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days.  You'd be doing me the favor.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Put the gun down, Somerset!
It surprises me.  It really does.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
Don't argue!...And stay close... Maybe they're rustlers...and maybe this dodderin' old idiot ain't so far wrong...
In that case, give the boys room...
Got a warrant?
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
You got one now!
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
That'll be the day...  'As we developed the village'... Next time you develop a village, hit it where the fightin' men are... You won't get any headlines for killin' squaws.
You've done a lot of growin'...
How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
You all settled an' comfortable now?
Think she means for us to follow?
I ain't sure...Where's that doll?
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
I got your boy killed.
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
But couldn't you...?
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
We just have to make a new beginning.
Maybe an animal.
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
You don't remember?
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
It's a pleasure.  You're from the city, right?
1976.  What happened back then?
I've killed my husband!
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
Good title.
A share of the profits.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Very well.
She is always Aphrodite.
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
I did not.
How will it?
Good title.
And yours?
Like Valentine and Silvia?
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
"Madam!"
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
You have opened the playhouses?
I was in a play. They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus. When I write plays, they will be like Titus.
I have to get back.
Will Shakespeare!
A lowly player.
I am.
It was the owl--come to bed
There is time. It is still dark.
Yes, some of it is speakable.
Oh, but it is mine too!
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
The Queen has consented?
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
My hat?
Your aunt?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
What of her bosom?
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
Have you seen him?
Alex, I don't have the time --
Think about it.
Is this necessary?
Anyway, what I was wanting to say was this --
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Cover it?
I don't know.
No. Why should it?
That's all?
I see.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
Yeah.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Then let's spend some money.
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
Your painful groin?
Where he can't get it?
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
We were just sorting things out.
No.
What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
What about?
Burglary?
Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
With a face like this?
Here.
I'm not sure --
Would you like to come in?
I'd be delighted.
Would you like to see the rest?
Did he sound upset?
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
I don't know, I think...
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
Gee, that's very serious...
I know.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
-- What?
I don't know. Just a minute...
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
That headboard.
You know what I'm talking about.
Then it's not your problem.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
No thanks.
No thanks.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Making it with my mother?
You think that's funny, don't you?
Then what do you think?
You are.
Yeah.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
It's hot in here.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
I won't screw you up.
What?
Hey, I don't tell.
You did, I know you did.
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
-- we can't now.
Fuckin' A --
Look who's talking.
-- well you better go after her.
What for?
I don't know -- I've got to.
Yeah?...
But then again you ask for it -- you just like my Otis -- can't keep his hands outta ladies' hair either.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- yeah, this is --
You said somebody... who?
Now, George --
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
Honey, what happened?
I am?
We live together now.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
How did it go at the bank?
Egypt!
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
I do, Jill.
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
Oh, Christ.
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
Did you?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
No?
But what?
They're not?
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Have a drink.
No --
What?
What do you mean?
Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Why not?
Oh, dear that's too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
I guess not.
-- No. No really.
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Honey?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
That's right.
Sure.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
Johnny!
Two weeks from tomorrow.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
Have they sat down?
Where to, Les?
You mean they ate each other up?
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Tony.
How does he tell you things?
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Okay, Mom.
Hey, wasn't it around here that the Donner party got snowbound?
Yeah.
Are you having a bad dream?
Because he hides.
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Well how can I repay you?
Awfully nice of you to say.  Of course I intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
I wouldn't know what to do with it if I did.
Pleasure to meet you.
Yeah.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
No, nothing at all.
Yes.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Stop it!
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Oh, I'll say.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
What's that?
What kind of noises?
Do I need one?
Save this one for last.
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
Marty, do you see your suspect?
It could have been anything, Marty.
I saw what I saw.
But Uncle Al! You said-
See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
Whatever.
Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I don't see?  You think I took vows yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You and Reverend Mother.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
Give me a C.  A C!
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
Don't you know it!
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Your cell.  Your room.
Useless distractions.
Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would happen!
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
Don't push it.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
I have?
I think they'd understand.
Really.
We didn't tell you what?
Yeah...
That's what I figured, too.
Really...
Measles.
Which convent was that, Sister?
Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a choirmistress?
We can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
What is that?
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf.
Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
What kind of nuts?
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
No, I couldn't...
No crickets or cicadas calling.  No bird songs.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
Stay back.
We should go.
Baltus Van Tassel.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
I know.  Hold on.
Take the reins.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
Come with me.
It was you there?
What did he say, Katrina?
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
I do not know.  Away.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
Father saw you die.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
You got any money?
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Can I see him?
What do you like to eat here?
Give me the big'uns.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
What?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
I hate you!
That's ridiculous. That's just a total lie.
You believe in the Bible?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
Childers.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
I don't want to worry your mama with company.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
Why did he do that, reckon.
I thought they was.
Well, I hate him.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
You know that girl I told you about. The one I love.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
It was fun, anyhow.
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Mama?
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Naw. Never did know too much of nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.
Do they know about you?
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
We sure like havin' you.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
I didn't mean that.
Wherever he wants to. I think he's going back to Millsburg where he's from. It's just about twenty miles from here.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
Two tins of Schimmelpennincks. And throw in a lighter while you're at it.
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
How'd you get started?
But they're all the same.
This is April Lee, Auggie. April, say hello to Auggie Wren.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Ready. Any time you are.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
Yes, I suppose I do.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
It's all yours, baby.
For keeps?
For keeps.
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
So I can get my job back.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Okay, Auggie, I got it. You don't have to yell.
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
You mean Rashid?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
Yeah? And why is that?
Jesus, Tommy, it ain't science, you know. You got your good trades and your bad trades. That's how it works.
I owe you something.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
You can't be more specific than that?
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is your father an artist?
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise.  It might be worth it.
I don't know. For helping me out.
Where did you get that thing?
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
I just did.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Don't worry about it. You've got friends now, remember? Just behave yourself, and everything will work out.
I was going to tell him ... but in my own time. In my own time... .
Now ask him who his mother was.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
Didn't say I was buyin' did I? What you want down?  Just bein' curious, is all.
Carl Heine's type.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
Well, what if?
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
Twelve.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Fell.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
I don't think so.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
For the third time, yes.
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Never mind leaving your door open - I got a passkey.
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
You're welcome.
My suitcase - with all my resort clothes.
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Where were you guys?
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
You're right, Joe.
We're not?
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
But suppose it doesn't?
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
Now you've done it!
Down, Daphne!
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
You - you -
This happens to me all the time in public.
Oh, he does!
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Get me Room 414.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
Stay as long as you'd like.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
What's the surprise?
Oh, Sugar.  You're going to spoil my surprise.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
Okay.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
Yes.
I am Cinderella the Second.
You invest in shows?
I'm not surprised.
Yes, Osgood?
Pleased to meet you.
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
You won't breathe nothing' - not even air.
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Afford it?
Me?
Rough?
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Every time!
Yeah.
About what?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
No, my flag steward.
Yeah.  Real hot.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
Guess!
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
It's the crews' night off.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
You mean you can't fall in love?
What else is there for me? 
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
You'll forget him, Sugar.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
We got different information.
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
You shave with your spats on?
Goodbye, Charlie.
But Im not taking your name, buster. Im a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
Are you sure youre okay?
Actually, I do.
Why, with you.
Im not as square as my daughter thinks.
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
And you do now?
No, tell me.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
What does your gut say?
But nothing did.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, well go back to the real world and...and youll be hiring me for your best friend!
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. Youre here for the highland flings, I bet.
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
You could? How?
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
No, Miss Johnson...
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
Yeah. We better git back to house now.
Hi, Daddy...
You bet we is!
They gone to the field...
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
When's that?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
Yes, David...
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
Can I go when the holiday comes?
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
It's the heat.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
Seems this piece of mail came to Mr. Howard's place this mornin' and he had me to bring it over here.
Little chilly.
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
But, Nathan--
That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
Will they give him a trial?
Behold my glory.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
Eric!
How would you like to gargle rat jiz?
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
Help yourself prickfuck!
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Huh?
It's... It's not good children.
Oh no, it's that kid.
Him? I don't know... He can be nice... sometimes.
Mrph mprph!!
Mrph mprhm mm rmph!
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Aw, ma!!
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
Oh... Alright, back you go.
We can't leave without you!
She's not my girlfriend, dude!
YOU BASTARD!!
Yeah, they suck.
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Right away, ma'am!
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Canada is saving us!!
What's the matter, Wendy?
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Oh yeah...
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
I'm sure I will.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
I'd advise you to shut up and let me finish Taylor.  You needn't worry about the lifepods because they're all gone, jettisoned. Save for one.
10-4 good buddy.
I know, I know.
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Just considering our options... sir.
Seen one like it before?
Helllp!
Hopefully sooner than later.
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Except write our wills.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
The engines!
Mac.  What's shaking?
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
Certainly.  I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
I know but we're in a bind.
A bowler.
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
It belonged to my dad.
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
So Buzz, let's skedaddle. Mr. Kastle is waiting. As Buzz gets up, Theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs.
It was a clearance.
- canker sore.
Right, eating at the core, eating it's way out. It makes me sick!
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
That game was before you was born.
Putt-putt golf?
You're in trouble, aren't you Buzz? You're doing something dangerous in that alley.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
J'you-and-your-friend do it yet? 
Blueface! Blueface is my favorite.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
I like the sport the way it is.
After we eat, Dad.
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
Like this?
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
The Peter Pan.
Won't your father help you with that?
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
We'll get into that later.
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
More than you could afford.
...lane six. Yes.
Why should I help that old fuck.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
You're really pissing me off.
Fuck plan C!
Suck my dick!
I'm not here to bowl.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your seat!
Wait a minute --
How about I just press the button?
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
That's our reserve air.
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Press?  No, I haven't.
It's impossible.
We think it might.  That's why we brought you here.  We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now.
I think I do.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped?
I did.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
What -- you want me to retype it?
She wired this system.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
Internal power.
And you didn't tell anyone?
You went through Edmunds' things?
You told him about me?
Don't do this.
You bastard.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Get the helium out of our bloodstream.  We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
But I don't know how --
Still clear.
You fixed this suit?  Beth?
He what?
None of this was here before.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
What?
Page 87.  "I could never read that far."
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be.
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Get away from the door, Beth.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Top shelf, is it?
Beth --
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
By the bunks.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
Another attack?
Is it coming from our own computer?
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
No.  I didn't say that.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
What do you mean?  She's not here?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Gimme a second --
I'm trying.  There.
Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake.
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
The ships?
Huh?
He's a pussy.
Take a look.  I rearranged the numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.  Go ahead.  Squint at it.
I don't see anything.
Try this one.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
Who's going to pay me then?
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
May the Force be with you.
What do you mean?
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
They use the Bogan Force.
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
All right, all right! You've got a ship!  But where do we go from here?  They probably took her to find the hidden bases... I don't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks.  The Empire has already beat us out.
Don't you believe it.
I don't know... I've never fought anyone.
I think I did.
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
Indeed, sir, sometimes I'm amazed we're in as good shape as we are, what with the rebellion and all...
I read you sir.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
Sir, no, sir.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
Oh, I see... teamwork.
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
So who's got time to get married ?
It wasn't luck. Rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
It's alright, I guess. You hear from anyone made it out of B.A. alive ?
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
That's it, we're empty ma'am !
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Sure.
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
You saying you didn't ?
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
They ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
Sir, thank you, sir !
No, sir.
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Hi, mom.
You heard me. Wanna make something out of it, private ?
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
Not a problem.
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
Uh, I don't know.
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
I can't My legs are gone... Get on the boat...
You may proceede.
<U>Why</U>?!
The information will not be disclosed.
By the Creator.
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
You asked my opinion, sir.
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
Decker....!
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Impact in fifteen seconds...
He's in Engineering, sir...  He doesn't know.
Hold relative position here...
Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more.
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
I believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel's inner mechanism. A technology so incredibly sophisticated that I cannot --
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
Everybody makes their own fun.  F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
Goodbye.
Mmm.
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
That's for sure.
Cast stood me up.
Fix my glasses.
You have to sign for it.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
No, that's true.
I'd love to.
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Well ain't you amazing.
But it'll stop the movie.
I'm going to tell the truth.
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
What are they offering?
We had a date.
I'm sorry.
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
And I need a drink.
Fifteen hands.
That's right.
Whyn't you learn your lines?
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
Page...<u>three</u>.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."
The people came to see a motion <u>Picture</u>.  ...hold on...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
You can go...
Everybody needs a hobby.  Okay, look Page...
Joe, the writer?
You mind...?
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
Mr. Barrenger.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Mr. Bailey.
I think he's moved...
She's absolutely r...
I'm not a <u>child</u>... I have <u>feelings</u>... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
Will you help me out...?
...we had a script conference...
I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you should do the scene.
And you know what...?
I'm only trying to...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Marty...
You said <u>three</u>...?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
Later for you, pal.
I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
My wife just went into labor...
You should.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
It burnt down.
I...
Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I...
I don't drink.
No, what is it?
I have to tell the truth.
The girl was in the car.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
He says they're looking for you all day, you're on <u>salary</u>, he needs <u>pages</u>, what are you, you been 'haying?'  Now:
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
What did you say to them...?
I didn't say anything to them.
I don't...
It's lovely.
Is that one hell of a kid?
George, that is so kind of you.
It takes all kinds.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
...we can't lose the wind...
Because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or I can lose the shot.
I don't care.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
Mass hysteria.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
That will never happen.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but...
Sex.  Of course.
...why do you think?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Or blush.  You look pale.
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded <u>dorkface</u> little adoring out-crowd <u>henchmen</u>...
You have to ignore him.
Yes.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
Hold lunch!
See, I...
I <u>killed</u> my math quiz, A-minus.
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
What honey?
Yes.
Half.  Of him.
No, it isn't.  Because it isn't everything.  And we want every- thing, don't we?
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
Let's take our best shot.
Have you still never told him?
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Good...Well...Take care.
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
To make it easier for them or you?
We...
I live or I die.
We don't have any coffee.
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
<u>Forgiveness?</u>  For <u>what</u>, exactly?
You got to hell!
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Brad Kovitsky.
How's she doing with Brad?
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Is that what he told you?
He won't discuss it.  Just calls it history.
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
We have to talk.
So I'll have to order in?
I trust you of course I do but --
Nobody's telling them to hate you --
What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
What?
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
My baby.
How did they execute him?
Poison gas.
I know!
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
Nothing, I guess
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
We're not ready.
I don't know. Maybe they'll like it.
550 verbal, 520 math. And I'm only in fifth grade!
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Well, I changed the ending a little.
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Oh, well, I don't have them yet, but 
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Maybe he's that one in a million!
You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Sure, Dad.
What are you doing here?
Well, now you have.
Can I join you?
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Say, Ni...
No.
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Oh, I don't remember that...
Yeah, sure.
Gee, your Dad's smart.
Yeah. I know.
Why? Are we going dancing?
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
You got it all backwards, Helen--but that's OK, you work for the government...
Shut up!
I don't want any...
How much do they have?
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
What?
Didn't they tell you?
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
What is your name, young lady?
Well, that's the funny part of it, too, sir.  It doesn't show a damned thing.
You aren't sure!
Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
Do you recognize my voice?
Certainly, General.  Why do you ask, sir?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
That is correct, Major.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
I'm trying to, sir.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where, sir?
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
What?
Speed?
Come on, Quentin, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Binky?
He's dead.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
Did you ever hear that saying, "This too shall pass"?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
No I quit.
Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
No, I'm here. Where are you?
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
No, no.
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Wait. Hey, man.
Guess not.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
Come on.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Alright, Pony!
I can come visit?
I will.
Good. See you later.
I could.
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
No, not really. Middle-class.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
I'd like to.
Let's see.
Taking care of business.
Oh, wow.
Funny shit, man.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Who were you talking to?
Ask your girlfriend.
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Oh, shit.
This is my home.
Look, your trespassing.
Nazeer Chaudry!
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
No, I don't.
For a ride.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
Oh, no, no. Uh, uh, George, pull over.
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah?
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
Would I get paid?
I can't believe you're still here.
If...
That's because I am.
Really? What else does your mother say?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
It's none of my business?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Well...
Oh, Jack...
Trix...
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
Bank branch!
Come on.
I'll take it.
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
As for instance?
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
So long.
Well, for heaven's sake!
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
If you please.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
It's a good script, isn't it?
Yeah?
Why?
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
What month?
Thank you.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
It's getting kind of late --
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
I need some money right now.
You think this is all very funny.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Why do you say that?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
No, they don't.
For me?  Okay.
We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night...
And she's turned you into a servant.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Yes, Madame.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
But where?
Softball.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
Western Europe.
When can I see, you again ?
You love me?
Come on, let's ride.
We're from different worlds.
What do you feel about me?
You're not afraid are you?
But why?
It seemed that way to me.
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
Remember me? We were in a disaster together.
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
Come back to my house. My car's outside.
Careful, don't make me angry. I start fires when I'm angry.
The scoop of the year!
I don't understand.
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
No, that's not true---there's well...no--
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
But Lana, you could --
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Kent!
Mom and I do this all the time.
You know what Mr. White said. A photographer always goes after a story.
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. Do you know what you are?
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
I'm tryin' to.
Black or regular?
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
Don't lay that jail number on me no more. You need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'Sides, I be known' some heavy stuff about you now. You don't want em spillin' the coffee beans.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
No, we're just going down.
We back in Metropolis?
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
Diet soda?
Where's the light switch?
You've got to pick three more numbers.
There is no handle! You just push a button.
It could make weather!
We already have a super-tanker.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
In July???
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Maybe you wanted to.
We'd better talk.
Never closed my eyes.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
Everything on it.
Does Lois know about this yet?
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
Sensible enough.
 DELETE IN CUTTING

Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
Zod.  Zod.
We must combine our strength.
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Politely?
I'm sorry.
I'll try. . .
Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Lucky I brought my drums.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
And stop interrupting. his is the big scene.  Your finest hour! You rose to the challenge, baby! And you lost. That's the best part!
--  thought about a rocket that carries a nuclear warhead in its nosecone and can strike with an impact of  --
No.
Not...gray.
Unbelievable.
He may have a gun!
Oh, for God's sake!
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
It was done with wires. They must have rigged him like they do with Peter Pan.
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
What can I tell you? He's my leader.
So I've noticed.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
You think he's for real?
I didn't say a word.
No, you're going to get kissed,
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Is that an innuendo, Miss Teschmacher? Because if it is, you are about to experience the heady thrill of being hurled from a moving vehicle.
There was a recipe on the back  --
But so is Vond-El
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
Guess I'd better hitch up the rig and come back to get that...that thing he was settin' in. What do you make of that thing? Martha? You listening?
How good it felt!
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
Not while I'm around you're not. C'mon...
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
It must feel great.
Thirty-five.
Pink.
Do you like pink?
I gave him this new face.
Will kill him! And I'm going to have a piece of the rock! Miss Teschmacher, pack your --
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
But...why?
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
--  Dropped into the sea!  Bye-bye California! Hello, new West Coast! Gold Coast! My Coast.  And now...well...  I left my heart in San Francisco...
And garbage doors.
Alison Jones.
I will.
I understand.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you this because... we've all lost our children, Mr. Ansel.
Okay.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Oh.  Right.
Can't you make it later?
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Good night.
You think that caused the accident, Risa?  That it brought bad luck? Christ, it sounds to me you're looking for a witch doctor, not a lawyer.  Or maybe they're the same thing.
What do you mean by that, Dolores?
Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
With our hands.
What's that, Dolores?
Billy said that?
I did.
Hi, Dolores.
I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
I'll...take it straight.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
No.
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
It's like a song.
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
I don't want you to lie.
You seem very sure about that.
I'm absolutely positive.
Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
And what was the weather like at this time?
Thank you, Nicole.
Hard to say.  I might have...some business here.
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
Almost three.
Is this it?
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
News?
I need money.
Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
No.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
You could see the speedometer?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
Really?
Of course.
I am.  Really.  It was awesome.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
Great.
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Is "he" inside?
But of course...
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Can't hurt...
A pocket fulla firecrackers - looking for a match!  It's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... I never thought I'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".
Is that why you were romancing her, you mutt!  Let's call it quits, my dear.  I'd like it fine if you found another home.  That means the front door is open!  Pack your things, rent a moving van and GIT!  And as for marriage, let me hit you with a few choice facts: you aren't ready for marriage!  You're incompetent - a capricious and shaky frail with a sick fatality for frail and useless men!
- He's got them on him.
Dallas?  Could be.  He doesn't look like a reefer smoker...
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
At the bar - Sidney...
You were thrilled to be interviewed.  Were you "interviewed"?
We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
Hello.
- that's what I mean!
Help me with two minutes of silence!
Yes.
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
Dallas, ask your own manager - he's standing here like a pained wolfhound - Hunsecker and Elwell are enemies to the knife.  So how do you get him doing J.J. a favor?
Good!  We're all off to Utica, so excuse me, Mr. Frannis-on-the- Portisan.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
I didn't do anything!
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
No, you had me eating that Chinese food!...
But I don't care about that now. He knew what he was doing today. He was laying down the conditions under which he MIGHT consent to our marriage - if I would bend to every whim of his, like Sidney!  I couldn't do that, Susie...
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
What chip?
No.  Only an object of equal size.
Why?
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Cool.
A hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
Smile?
No problemo.
I'm sorry, John.
Gimme that Phillips right there.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I love you, John.  I always have.
SHOOT!!!!
No.
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
And no elbows on the table!
Right. So, this is going to be very formal, too, now. Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares.
David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
was born here, in Leipzig. I escaped in '36. My parents, they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia. They were to follow. But they delayed and...
So what is it?
and totally irrelevant.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Colonel. Pleasure.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwngler?
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
Yes.
Mine's the Eleventh.
I can't do this. It's not right.
I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
I don't buy that.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
I was warned.
And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
Isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, Von Karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
Yes, that's what happened.
No, that's your problem, Wilhelm. You understand nothing. We'll call you. Go!
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
Okay, so what is it?
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Furtwngler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Never heard of him, who is he?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
He was forced to do that. But he refused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler. He kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.
Politics and art must be kept separate. I'll remember that. But let me see if you can help me with something I just don't understand. I'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. What's his secret?
Was looking at Furtwngler like that?
Hey, hey, slow up, Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say.
It was Beethoven's Ninth.
Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
That's none of your business.
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
That's the way it was told to me.
Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
You're not supposed to.
Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
To make a statement. I'm gonna give them the name.  Maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
Like shit, boss.
Shut up.
The stock will turn.
Now, look...
Then, you kiss his ass.
I apologized, I offered to help.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
This can't be real...
Alright... okay...
A game?
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
What are you talking about?
Why not?
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
You pull me up.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Can we talk?
Is this you?
Well... the red bra.
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
I didn't say anything.
I don't know.  A lot.
Fuck you.
That's not true...
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
No.
Always.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
"Consumer Recrreation Services." What, do they make golf clubs?
Why?
Okay.
Slow down, take a breath...
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Really?
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Yes, very lucky.
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
Yes.
I'll call.  I really will.
What's all this for?
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
A game?
Nobody knows, pal.  Nobody gets the big picture...  Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
It was a different floor then...
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
The Hinchberger wedding.
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
I know who she is.  Take a message.
Don't ask.
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
What about the house?
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
I did okay.
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
There's a carriage house around back.
-- how much is this car worth?
And that will be a good place to end this study.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
No you're not.  Something moved you.  You saw something.
Why?
It doesn't matter.  Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me.  What I do with this is up to me.  I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer.  And I want to be the volunteer.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Test it.
That?  That's Hill House.
Nell, what do we do?
Oh!  You scared me.
Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
Fifteen dollars.
I don't know what you mean.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Then let's go get you one.
As soon as you get dressed.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
We can't find ...  ... two of our guys.
This is un-fucking professional.
That's why I'm letting you take care of this.  I'm the one with appearances to maintain.  But who gives a shit about you?  Not even God.
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean?
No reason.
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
Has he?
Not much -- you?
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
No, but I know what he means.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Been busy, have you.
What was that, then?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Try calling me again.
Weren't you on a television series?
Not ashamed.
Yeah, well, she started all that in London.
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
Eight hours difference between here and London.  Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  I was just coming out on the yard.  Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do.  And I'll tell ya:  I couldn't open the paper.  Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  That's how weak my hands went.  Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't.  Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white.  I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ...  Something had happened to Jen.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
What do you think.
I'll bloody well ask him.
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
And how did you get it?
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Hey?
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
Poor baby.
Too bleeding true, 'n' it.
All of what?
He had urgent business in the north.
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
No kidding.
... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
I don't know.
The L.A.P.D.
There is?
You bet.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
What's in it?
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
Are you finished?
Go now.
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards...
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
Huh.
I can get it, yeah.
Come in, come in, siddown over there. Coffee?
No. I--tell me--
Well, I'll be damned. The barber! And I thought this trip was a bust. Well...
Right! Strictly business.
Look, uh... Creighton...
She's a rare one.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
Mm.
Congratulations, Gina.
You don't have to--
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But the point is that if Mr Prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! But we can't *know* what really happened! Because of Fritz, or Werner, or whatever the hell his name is! And because Me Prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! Because it's easier *not* to look! Because the more you look, the less you know! But the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! We just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. Science. The atom. *You* explain it to me. Go ahead. Try.
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Yeah, the best.
Huh?
Yeah.
Whuddya mean?
OK.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
My *wife*?
Yeah--
Behind you.
Hurry up!
You said the system couldn't fail!
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
Everybody.  Get behind me.
I know.
I hope you liked it.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
I don't believe it.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
Healing plant use among the Ki tribe of Bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.
What are they?
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
Yes.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
He's right.  Follow me.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
What?
There's another possibility.  A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
What are you going to do?
I think... it means it's full.
That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
I can't!
Where exactly?
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
He moved down there after Meryl packed up and left.
What's to see?
Why would we--
What music?
--a dead one at that.
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
Of course.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
You think she'd go through with it?
I think I've studied enough.
This is where it started.
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
How do you know?
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
You blaming me for the traffic?
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
Oh, just so.
I'll try.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
There's no one here.
I'd ask for identification.
You can count on it.
A woman?  Work.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
And if it's unsuccessful?
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Of what?
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
Old friend of your father's.
You a reporter?
Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
And one little boy.
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
You've been using me --
I'm on the roof.
What's wrong, Scully?
Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost --
Scully, I found the bomb.
Why?
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
General McAddie's.
I'm not taking any chances.
He's come and gone.
A virus?
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Where is he?
The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  Or it may not.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
Okay.
He needs to be turned over.
How hard could it be...?
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore.  Not to him.  He never finished her.  The others...he was able to make them his.
Yes.  I am.
Yes.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Now?
It's his dog.
No.  Can you get a man close?
Do you understand German?
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
He was Harry's driver?
Why don't you leave this town - go home?
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
I thought you wanted...
Holly.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
I saw him today.
That's the reason.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
Can I have that woman's passport?
September '39.
Pin it on a...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Going to find me the real criminal? It sounds like one of your stories.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
Win what?
I'll do what I can, if she'll let me.
No, a major, were you really?
Heard of Harry Lime?
Goodness, that's awkward.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
Did the police believe you?
Zwei zwartze.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Mr. Lime - yes.
You remember me? Upstairs...
You don't mean that doctor?
Something wrong.
Will we never teach these Austrians to be good citizens. It was his duty to give the evidence.
Yes.
Oh.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
I think we're about half way.
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we dont try then we'll never know.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
No one follows that midrash.
What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi.
They sound like you.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
That's a movie, you moron.
Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and --
I don't, but...
Just don't.
You will.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
Is he a Nazi?
He's at a home out here.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
You shouldn't.
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They're liars and cowards.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
Why?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Give me a reason not to.
Does that mean you deny what he says is true? Yes or no.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
You're lying.
Balint?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
What...?
The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
Get out of my way.
Funny?
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
And let us say...
What do you mean?
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Very much, I think.  But, there's going to be a problem.
Italian is practically the same thing.
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
Okay.
How do you know that?
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
... What's your name again?
Fine!
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Not at all!
You're staying at the hotel?
Get in the car!
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
It's too loud for me.
Thank you...
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
Anything.
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
I'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  Did you bring the cassettes?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
In the spring when he melts!
Let him sleep.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
Sure. Why not.
I said, yeah, about once a week!
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
He's still working out some identity issues.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Resting?
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
That depends. How much money has he?
Good looking?
Mmmyes.
Drink your beer and don't get so excited.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
No. I'm serious about this.
That's the place: I remember - My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
Why?
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
We're old friends.
Just barely possible - - yes.
I am not interested in what somebody else thinks. You being me facts and I'll act on them.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Don't be soft.
I know. Funerals.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
I know -- Teresa -
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Must it?
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Anything is possible.
You... You found that at Leons?
Excuse me?
Yes... You woke me up... Its the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Whats in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation?  Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womans intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
How... When did you...
Leon didnt hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
Something like that.
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
The staff dont know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldnt take any more...
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassys out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Dont fall asleep with your hair wet.
That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
Its up to you whether they walk or not.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
This is a bad line.
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
Where?
The company. We all work for the company.
Got it. Puppies.
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Its Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Bye bye, Jane. And dont be naughty.
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
Huh. Id have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientle. Get rid of them and were out of business.
Maybe I dont.
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
You-youre wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time Im in London. Thats all.
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
Would you know where I might reach her?
Cinq cents.
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
My lord, I'm not sure that...
Do you think I could have some water?
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Better today than tomorrow.
There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as you said!
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
Tell me...
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
Yes...
Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
Rouen is in English territory.  I have the right to do anything I like.  Take them away.
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Yes...
He's feeling wonderful.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
... You look wonderful...
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
If she comes from Burgundy it makes a difference.  It might be a trap...  Look... Signed "X".  What sort of name is "X"?  Or must we conclude that a messenger of God can't even write her own name?
Does he have hair?
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
Did your voice tell you to jump?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
Yes, but...
Nothing... just taking his teeth.
Don't swear...
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
No, I...
No...
But you already confessed this morning...
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
And what does he say to you?
You can't, it's too dangerous.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Dead.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Just shut up.
They were taking you away.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
So, what's the news?
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
Can you help? I've no money...
You're a dirty pig!
I'm not going anywhere.
A pianist.
In the attic.
Show me.
The Russians. On the other side of the river.  All you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"'
Oh indeed. Cotton'.
And where did they get married?
The Alps.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
He chopped it off
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
You've missed this bit.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
He'll probably fall down.
Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened?  He get ya with the knife?
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
No.
Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a fool if you don't get into it.  A bigger fool than I was.  I been lookin' for this one all my life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance to step out at the top.
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
I like griftin'.
Hackers.
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
I picked something up on the way.
Lonnegan after you, too?
Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else do I gotta know.
Why?
You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A torpedo or somethin'.
No, not a thing.
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
The wire is ten years outa date.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Nice work, J.J.
Raise 5,000.
Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I put the finger on ya.
But what about all these other people?
2:00 A.M.
All right, do me a favor.  Go into the bathroom, open the window and wait for me there.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
I'll make parole.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
I think he will.
I'm sorry.
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
Why did that man want to kill him?
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
I didn't.
Hello, there!
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
tried him once -
You see how much we have to say.
Yes, she would.
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
And he still wants to marry me!
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
What's he want of you?
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
He's holding out on you.
Trail him!  Trail who?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Why yes.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
They'll be here.  Don't worry.  My men are picking them up.
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Where were you?
Slim.
Yes...
Someone get a doctor.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick!
It was his body that was buried there.
Hey... hey.  Don't do that.
Mimi!
I wish you'd tell me.
You're forgetting the check for your suitcase.  It's at the Grand Central.
Y-yes.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
He's not so--
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
We can't just go off and--
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
Why'd he come in our camp.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
And let me guess who is.
What about Jaeger?
What does it look like I'm doing?  I'm killing Iraqis.  At-at-at-at-at.  At-at- at-at--
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting?
OH MY GOD!
What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
But we all got to be in for this.  We all go, or we do nothing.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
You can't tell anybody about this.
I know.  I know.  But I'm saying, if they knew.  We're going to be millionaires, man.  Millionaires!
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
So where do we start?
Get up and dig.
He's not going to leave us.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
There's another pass on the photo.  We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down.
How!?
Wes is dead!
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
Sure.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
Then I'm a rich man.
How the hell should I know?
I could use some recon photos too.
A headache?
Now you need me.
What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
For real?  A treasure?
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
We got to get out of here.
You have to go with us, Wes.
You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
Permant cortex bond.
Look,dirt!
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
No!  Don't go.
I'll try.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
You don't know.  You don't....
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
What?
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
Don't say that.  You look...  You're not well.
Get out of here, Leave me alone.
Look!
Yes...
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Where you guys at?
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Don't touch that.
Make up your mind, trigger.
How the hell do you feel yellow?
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Oh shit...
We work fast enough for you?
Hey, I'm next.
We've created a monster.
Take him!
A ticking bomb...
Reilly, what're you doing here?
C'mon, it's a quiet night.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
Report on the case so far.
Yes, sir.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
Constantinople?
No!
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
Like it?
Just dull.
Doc--!
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
Yes, Baron.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
Um-hum ...
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
You say I am a crook.
Good day, Major.
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
Thank you.
The pepper, too?
The fourteenth of May.
What?
Five, seven, and nine--
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
But, Lily--
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Yes.
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
Too much blue in crimson.
Oh? 
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
Like that?
You're conceited--
No--thirty-five! 
It could have been marvelous ...
Yes--uh--
What is it, madame?
Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.
To M'sieu Laval?
Please!  Thank you.
Right!
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Well, he was in the navy.
The pumps --
Hurry, Rose.
Lewis...
Don't drop it Rose.
That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
...Mrs. Calvert?
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
Not the better half.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
What do I tell your mother?
Good. Settled then.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
No you won't.
Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Is he your boyfriend?
It is that simple.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
I see you.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
A whole ten cents?!
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
That's enough.
Just tell us what you can --
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
That's a date. 
I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
Want to take it back?
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Good-by.
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
There's soft music--
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
At seven-thirty?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
Shortie, look!
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
Thanks. That makes us square.
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
O.K. Heads you win.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Back is in New York.
Yes--Me--in person!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
She's in New York.
Miss Marsh.
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
What do you mean?
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
What's he got that I haven't got?
--And he has sex appeal.
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
Sure, Sis.
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Actually, you know, that's not a Bad idea, send a signal we're Growing up.
And you must be Doc Holliday.
Good.  That's real good.
This brand.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
I was kidding about that.
I been having the boy at the Hotel pack us up every night Since your streak started
Not exactly...
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Never got to wear one of those.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
Hell, I got lot's of friends.
I don't.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Where do you get these questions?
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
Forget it, Ringo.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Not anymore, not after this.
Might as well hear him out. Anyways, what choice we got?  But no matter what happens, see It through to the end.  If you don't I'll curse the day I ever laid eyes on you.
Morg, use your head.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
That a fact?
They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
Better go with 'em, honey.  Here's Where I leave you.
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
None of my business, Fred.
What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin? 
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
- We all want what we can't have?
Is this another one of your games?
Nothing.
To the best of my recollection, Mr. Bond, I suggested no such thing.  In fact, I was never here.
Let's take a look at the body.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial loan division. If you're ever lookin' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
Sidney Winch.
So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond?  Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
Up.
... We have time for that?
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
Yes, M.
Of course.  Minister Johnstone.
You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way.
Who's Wade?
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
The Queen invited you to dinner -
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
- I told you! He was there! -
Approaching the first gate.
Will you still get the money from your father?
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
That is called a crab apple switch. It's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog. Now I don't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk's stories but I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home. I was up in Memphis working on the railroad, like your daddy who had an easy job. He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track. Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon. Sure enough it was Emory. My daddy taught both of us to play but Emory was natural at it. Got in a blues band and what not. He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they balled the Jack leaving town. Emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face. Bad luck I would say. He got to drinking that corn liquor. We went to his girl's room and he wouldn't stop drinking. He started talking about the old days and he went mad. He pulled his knife and I got to mine first. The lights went out.
I don't know what happened to him. He just ran out into the streets.  I got some old records I want you to hear. I like the blues sung simply, man and a guitar. Or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life. Don't ever let anyone tell you his life's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness. When I was a boy, a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I'll be damned if the same thing didn't happen to me.
No, I'm too hot now.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
How is the garden doing?
Well if you're sure, I won't be a bother. Oh, I don't sleep on no spring mattress. I always make myself a pallet on the floor.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
You should go back and rest.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
You must have done something to her.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
Harry always shows his good side and, like the moon, the other side is black. Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman. I'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil. I'm warning you -- you can't keep a wild animal as a pet around children.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Where is Skip?
Bye, house.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Alright Buzz, get ready...
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
How 'bout three out of five?
No she's NOT --
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
A lunchbox...?!
I can't tell.  Hey, where's Lenny?
Now, it was an accident!  Guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
I thought he was at summer camp!
Speed up!
There's not.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
I can't go home because there's no home left.
Did you now.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
Goodbye Arnie.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything. You're like the Gestapo.
You do?  What else you do?
No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
So go shower already.
Yes, sir!
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
What is it you want me to do?
It could mean that, yes.
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
Just tell me where she is.
I see where you're going with that, but if I could just say something, which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he doesn't know how to let himself be helped; it's a point of pride to take every bullet, no matter who fired it, or whether it was even aimed at him, which personally I think it very self-defeating.  Now, don't get me wrong, he's a man of enormous integrity, but there's a political component to this job that the General just didn't have any patience for.
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Jesus.
Thanks.
I'm going home.
Shut up.
No, not holding hands.
Can I see you again?
Certainly not.
Is that a promise, then?
Unless you get caught.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
Nightmare.
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Screenwriter?
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
Despite the Academy award?
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
That's hardly a substitute.
Your favourite dish.
Are you serious?
No joy yet.
She read it in Cosmopolitan.
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
With a starship!
He doubts me.
It's all I have.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
I do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
I was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
Yes, Captain.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
General Korrd's military strategies were required learning when I was a cadet at the Academy. When they put me out to pasture, I hope I fare better than Korrd.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
If you think it would help.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
There, you see? See?
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
He did have pointed ears.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
No conditions.

Something about tampering. Some body's prob'ly trying to siphon the R&D budget into his checking account, I don't know. Why are you so interested?
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Yes, won't that be grand -- the computers will start thinking, and people will stop. Lora, I'm going to stay and run some data through. See you tomorrow.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Ok
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
For sure...
Let's get outta here.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
Greetings, program...
You're alive!
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
It's too far!
Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Tron...?
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then...
We have to.
We have to get off this beam!
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Simon?  Ohmygod.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Why?
This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
Here, check these out.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
You tell on me, I tell on you.
I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
No!  Never!
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They needed some documents down at the court house.  I barely made it.
Not because you were attracted to him?
No.
Well, maybe a little.
Natasha?
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
You wouldn't believe me.
Are we going to die?
God, you have great legs.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Use 'em and lose 'em.
Those idiots.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
Hold that thought.
Yes.  Go ahead.
Yes.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
I don't know.  I have to think...
No.  He checked out okay--
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
How come?
Don't eat anything.
Get it.
The oriental.
Sonny kicks ass.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
How 'bout me what?
There's nothing to tell.
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Do you have a fella?
Almost four years.
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Can you live with it?
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
She's with me.
You goin' out?
What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day.
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Elliot what?
Um, nothing, let's go?
In case.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
Who's Sonny Chiba?
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Want an animal cracker?
The police department?
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
No. Not yet.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
What?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
You were a cop.
On their honeymoon.
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
That's bullshit.
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Do you live here?
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Yes.
Do you know where we can find him?
I went to the surface and I collected specimens like I was told.
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
You're still a little... disoriented.
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
Do you know why you're here, James.
It's so clean.  No germs.
July?!
No more drugs.  Please...
What?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
The man...with the voice.  I recognized him.  He's from the present.  He...
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
The gun! ... I lost it
It was?  I didn't...know.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
Yes, sir.
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
Nothing.
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
One way.
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
Twenty-after-ten.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Nothing.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
Hundred-fifty.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
Come back when the sun comes up.
What's it to you?
You got beer?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
John . . .
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
There's someone in the house.
What does it look like?
Jake.  No.  No!
Maybe I don't want you to.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I got it.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
Like you.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Such as?
Still playing?
I can't.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
John, please--
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
Because I know you're full of shit.
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
Don't yell at me!
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
Now what?
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
I think I busted my leg.
The trunk.  It's locked.
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
A lot that means.
My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
I put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  Which is?
How much could you get?
You're not buying a car, for Christ sake.  You're having your wife killed.  I'm the one who's neck is stuck out.  It's thirteen, or it's nothing.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
Christ, Jake, please--
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
She's dead.
You're too quick for me.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Will you shut up!
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
What happened?
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Sure, Sheriff.
And as soon as I see that you're on your way.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
I'm not rambling.
And what does that make you?
You love her, but you hate her?
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
But you was going to fight for me.
What's your name anyway?
Yep.
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
You've been there?
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
It's Grace.
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Thank you.
The same thing you do.
And what would that be?
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
I'm just flesh and blood, baby.  That and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  But you already know that.  You read my mind, remember? Thanks for the lemonade.
You love him?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I don't know how.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller.
I'll fuckin' take it. To go.
Wrong number.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
I have a lock on the door.
Rust?
Think carefully?
I don't know Megan.
Is there a problem?
Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
We are.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
Elijah was wrong.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
No.
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
Where is it?
Thank God.
Down the street and across. Greely's Beer Garden and Billiard parlor. Just ask for Alice and say you want a game of billiards.
She back in Kansas?
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
Oh.
Be careful with those, sonny.
He admit it?
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
Word must have got all the way to Texas by now.
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
Like I said, I...
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
No,... but I can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
N-no, sir?
Lemmee see that Schofield, Kid.
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
Hold on, mister.  Son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. Penny, you give yer brother a hand...
I could of... easy.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Huh?
He got the boy's horse.
After a ways.
Shut up, Kid.
Yup.
Lemmee see it.
Sure. Sure, Bill.
Yeah?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
This Kid, what's he like?
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
Beats the hell out of me.
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
Better'n you anyhow, Kid. You wasn't comin' close.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
We done that stuff.
Well, suppose he does?
Yeah?
They just said they wanted time.
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
I don't know. This is bad.
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
What do you care what he says?
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
Russian, I think. I don't know.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
I'm not a rat.
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
Why didn't you say anything?
YES YOU DO. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING AT. THE TRUTH. TRY TO TELL ME YOU DIDN'T KNOW. TRY TO TELL ME YOU SAW SOMEONE KILL KEATON .
I don't
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
How did you settle on the amount?
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
And what did your team do...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
No.
How is that?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
You would not...?
You didn't write that figure.  And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
I doubt we'll have to go to trial ...
Why is that?
That's what I'd planned to...
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Do you know who her doctors were?
The most respected ...
And ask me what?
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Mr. Concannon...?
Kathy Price.
Missus...
And what are you?  A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
Yes.  It was, actually.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
Well, then what are you doing here?
Who told you that?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Yes.   We've all got to let go.
No.
I have to talk to you.
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
Right.
I'm swell.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
What difference can that make...? All right...
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
I don't know.
It's locked.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... I'm sure you do ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
She told me.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
As I've said we had some more...
Yes.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
Okay.  Now, so he's in jail.  He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake.  As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.   P.S.  He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink  and mopes around three and a half years.   You like that story?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
I -- I --
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
Did she hurt herself?
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
You won't have to.
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Why?
No, you don't owe me anything.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
But why?
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you."  But I did.
What are you going to do?
Where were you?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
When?
You like it, too.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
No.
I... didn't know where you lived.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
Meet again, sometime.
We have.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Only silence. It's always like this.
Madeleine!
Yes...
No!
There's a name on the gravestone.
No!
I'm here, I've got you...
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I know. Everybody tells me.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
My... the acrophobia.
I think I can lick it.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Who?
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
Carlotta?
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
No, not exactly. Want to see?
I thought so!
You're interrupting a personal conversation.
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
Why was the floor wet?
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
Eat my ass!
I'm not getting a ticket.
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Just stop.
What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal...
We've already done this.
That is absolutely not true.
I am not flexible on this.
You got us into this mess.
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
What.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Nothing happened in Vegas.
I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
Lois please.
Sweet deal.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
I don't know! I just want to get married.
I just want to get married.
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Just do it.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Now?
I'm serious.
Ball park sausages.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Sent it.
Yup.
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
Why?
Why did you forget the tent check?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
Not padded ones.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Not yet.
Hey. It's me.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
Yeah. You.
No it's not okay. It's not.
Don't even.
What?
Do you love me?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
What?
Just kills me...
I love you dad.
I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey.  And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out.  You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead!
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
It means she's insecure.
Buzzing?
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
A move?
Downstairs in the closet.
My God...
That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think?
I don't think that's a good idea.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
Tell me the answer to this! What bird lays eggs in a barn?
I'm well ... The bus was late, wasn't it? ... What was the journey like?
You see, even the voice.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Only because you want it.
Yes, it is.
No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Fifteen yards.
No, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
Is she coming back?
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
I wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I'll leave it to you.
What's he called?
A black bull!
But, miss ...
I had so many things to think about!
I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming. It is thoroughly secured, which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it.
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
Whatever.
But only you will know he's not human.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
Where's my gun?
If you're lying, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
I need your help--
Got it.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
This is a full pardon. It authorizes your immediate release.
No, but I've confirmed the reelection rally is the target.  How much C-4 is missing?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
I'm still making adjustments...
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it  I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Enough!
What you need is a collar.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
As a matter of fact, it is.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Both.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
...I think so...You?
I don't know.
Let me put it to you this way... whether I'm here...or whether I'm not...I'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night.
Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
Well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent.  We bring'em back <u>tomorrow</u>, the charts go up, they don't go <u>down</u>...
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
Can we have a white one, please...
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
What are you talking about?
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
What difference does it make if it's true?  It's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- How long've we got til it breaks? 
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
All I need is the one day.
One day, Two days?  <u>Course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
Why?
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
8 days and we bring it back home....
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
And I can only say, to those family members, <u>of</u> group 303, which members are, I know, as I speak, gathering to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, I can only say,
Whaddaya think?
S'only got to hold for another few days.
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
"The Country Is At War." 
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
They got him standing by.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
No.  You're right.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit.  This may take a while.
Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
He ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
When do you bring'em back?  Schumann.
Yes.
I believe in you....
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
By the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
Not in here Dad... please. Later.
Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that.
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
So what firm you with, pal?
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
Why do you need to wreck this company?
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Dump it.
Yeah, almost...
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
Why?
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
You got it, G.G.
You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it.
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Vell.  Goodnight.
What?  Tony and China, together?
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
Who's is all this?
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
Safety in numbers man.
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
What do you mean?
You think you influenced her?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Almost.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
At the party.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
I have to go.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
You do?
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
Stop.
You are?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
It's niiice.
Jody, wait.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Something was there.  You saw it.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
Three weeks.
Don't.
Yep.
You know what I mean.
I know.
Did she say that?
I know.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
When?
...like it never even happened...
Well, that's a relief.
What are you...?  No.
Sabotage?
No, it's fine.  I'm fine.
Really big bed.
Wouldn't go that far.
Your wife...
STOP IT!
That's not what I'm sayi--
What did you think I would do?  Jesus Christ!  I gave up my life and my music...
She's gone.
I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
Claire...
Incredible.  We should take a drive before they're gone.  Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
Look for antiques...
Don't think so.
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Then what is he...?
Two heartbeats.
Come.  There is a lot to read
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
Nothing was ever more false.
In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
Then you wear it.
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
It wes a dream...!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
There are things you will not tell him.
Always loved you..
You bastard...
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
Do not tell me that!
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
And whose houses do you design...?
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Mm-hmm...
No.    This is unreal...
Your beneficence.
I'm serious.    Whatever it was - it's still there inside me, isn't it - change and all...?
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
The one on the left - definitely...
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
You know that circulation is down for three months in a row.
I really don't know what to say
Don't worry - Is that my hammer  Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
Open it...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
You heard me - keep away from him
I'm good - I was just making a delivery near here, so I thought I would see if you were about...
Yes - one please.
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Perv.
Let me get this straight...
We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
So that's a maybe?
Yeah? You like?
That was code for "I like you."
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Maybe on the outside. But inside, deep down, I've always been dripping with special sauces.  Are you hungry?
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.
It's my private business! Mine!
Well, why should I?
They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy.
I will not have my boys arguing.
The one with the horses.
Of course we were.
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
It's not up to me.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
Me-ow.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
Why can't you be nice to me?
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
It's incredibly simple.
You're amazing.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
Amen to that.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
That's hard to believe.
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Let your fingers do the walking.
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
Of course I like girls.
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Why, look who's here.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents.
Kelly Van Ryan...
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
And where might that be?
What about the blood?
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
Take your time.
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid.
I net a guy in a bar.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
So you were alone.
What was that?
I don't care.  You heard that girl's statement.  I think he's dirty.  Get me a case.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
Police -- God -- get a life.
You know what it takes.
No little girl can ever make me come.
Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
About what?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
Are you mad at me?
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Shit. Here we go again.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Jim West.
Always hoping.  Or this...
Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
Starting with a screw?
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota...  Willard, New Mexico?
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
I know!  I know!
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Yes, me!
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
Fine, I'll stop.
Private train?
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
Yes!
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
It's a smelting retort.
In an hour they're gone!
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
It's a matter of great importance to me!
I love you.
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Don't worry, Willow.  She's in good hands.  You haven't made a mistake.
Watch it!
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Kill him!
Then I will teach you.
The art of transformation!
There's nobody here.
Yes!  Raziel!  She lives out on that island!
I don't know much about him.
Sorry. It's important.
Oh sure, Fred.
...I want to say a thing.
What's that, Sam?
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Maybe.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
We do not go into your courts.
No.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
No, no doctor...
Something wrong with buttons?
Anything against zippers?
We had some lemonade and he left.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
There was.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Here. Whenever you want them.
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
God, Fred...
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
Yes.
If any!
I don't believe you!
This?
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Uh-huh.
Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
I'm sure he could give you some courage.
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my! 
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Yes, you.
This way!  Come on!
Yeah --
NO!
Ohhhh -- it's me!
We do.
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
I can fairly hear my heart beating!
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....
Help!
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
What the hell are you talking about?
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
The King pipeline.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
You dont take no for an answer, do you?
I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
You had your chance, James. Now Im looking for a bigger thrill.
I think you do.
Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
Please.
Someone will come.
Yes.  Au revoir...
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Still no contact yet.
Why?  What's the problem?
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Veidts complex.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .

His . . . whatever.
You and me.
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just paranoia.
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
-- What?
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
What does this mean?  What does it --
Am I free to go?
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you, Mr. X, you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not?
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
What's the deal?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
Of course.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
What's that?
Uh-huh.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
Come with me and I'll let her live.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Poppycock!
From your office, sir.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
Hello...?
Surprised?
And your passport?
I promise.
I hope you like large weddings.
Goodbye, darling!
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
Yes!... the laboratory.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
A week.  Ten days at most.
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Oh!  I thought it was Dr. Frankenstein.
Yes?
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
How do you do?
Why are you talking like that?
I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
How?
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
Thank you, Master.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
You can say that again.
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
Maybe...if you get here on time.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
MMMmmmmmmmm.
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Well, this explains the music.
Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
What do you think we should do?
Yes -- quickly, dear!
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
But will they make good use of them?
Thank you.
Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
